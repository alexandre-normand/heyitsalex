I’m a Software Engineer and eco-geek with *passion*. I’m serious, except when I'm not. I will raise my voice to make you understand why I think some things are important until you put earplugs on and stop listening to anything I have to say.

I work at [Opower](http://opower.com), possibly the greatest company ever. It is for Opower that I moved all the way from Montreal and I  steale my wife and kids from the good life we had there.

I also do photography and I think I’m pretty good at it. I mean, as much as the other million dudes with big dSLRs and expensive gear. I also like to think I might be able to draw better than a 4 years-old at some point.

I’ll leave you, the reader (that’s how I’ll call you), with this quote about me:

I’m without internet for the last 4 hours, do you know what’s happening? Static IP? What?! You changed it without warning?

     – My wife, after I had remotely set our sonic.net account to use a static IP
