       <div class="post content">
        <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>I write code for a living and I’ve loved it since the first day. What was the date you ask? Now, come on. I don’t know the <em>exact</em> date but I remember the origin story.</p>
<p>A key plot point is my older brother taking a programming class in high-school. <em>Key in Face to Face or Pennywise playing in the background</em>. I don’t know how much he enjoyed it but he did keep his course notes clean and, importantly, in a place where I eventually found them. And finding them, I did. At the time, I had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrix_Cx486">Cyrix 486 CX</a> PC that I bought from money reselling my own stuff and mowing lawns. It was the best I could buy with the money I had, all of it. It wasn’t great but it was <em>something</em>. This was in the dial-up days and when Cyrix was making cheap(er) intel processors.</p>
<p>While it’s interesting to think about that era with some nostalgia, none of it really matters except maybe that writing software required some effort, energy, curiosity and patience (and all the money a kid could get his hands on). And also, it was also a lot of fun.</p>
<p><img src="https://heyitsalex.net/images/Nibbles_screenshot.png" alt="nibbles"></p>
<p>When I got my hands on the programming class course notes, I was thirsty for more. It might be a little embarrassing to say now but that course’s curriculum was all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC">QuickBasic</a>. So yes, <code>QBasic</code> was my first programming language. I went through all course notes and exercises and it seemed to just click naturally to me and I enjoyed it a lot. I did all the course’s assignments but that was over quickly. So, naturally, I started thinking of new problems and new cool things to try out. I even started hacking on some games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game)">Nibbles</a> and played with the limited graphics capabilities (which wasn’t really part of the course). I always loved drawing but was never great at it. Being able to type code that created pleasing visuals game me a creative outlet for which my hands weren’t naturally gifted for. I carried that sense of wonder and possibilities the next semester when, naturally, I took that class myself.</p>
<p><img src="https://heyitsalex.net/images/ibm_pc_at.jpg" alt="IBM PC"></p>
<p>The class took place in a computer lab with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_AT">IBM 286 PCs</a>.
Every week, we’d learn something new and then work on assignments. You see, computers weren’t so common that the school could assume we could do that work at home. For most, the new learnings were the ones in the curriculum but, for me, who had already done the class at home the summer prior, learnings were whatever new things I could discover. The best time in those classes were the allocated period to work on those assignments. There’s nothing to brag about since they weren’t new to me but I usually completed those very quickly. Then I’d try to add little fun features or polish. Sometimes I just had another idea that popped up in my head and I went ahead and made it happen. I can’t remember now what those ideas were exactly. I just remember the fun of building my own things. Eventually, the teacher would notice I was working on something cool doing his rounds and would get the other kids to come and see what I had done. That was my first learning to deal with interruptions and develop an appreciation for the focus time. There was zero privacy in the computer lab but, until someone interrupted, it was me, the screen and the keyboard and it was a good time.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is more of the same. It wasn’t without struggles, of course. I’d later try to take on too much at once and write my first 3D game, learning win32, DirectX and game development all at once&hellip;and failed. But, I kept going and developed my love for the craft.</p>
<h2 id="-caution">⚠️ Caution</h2>
<p>Before I dive into it, I want to warn you. As the title hinted, this is a case for resisting AI. I’m not questioning whether AI is inevitable but rather whether it’s <em>desirable</em>. <em>I</em> am deciding to resist the temptation to use AI for software development and resisting helping its growth. I know I’m just a guy that happens to just work in this industry and what I personally do does matter. Being the guy against AI doesn’t change how anyone I work with decides to play the game. And I’m not going to try and convince <em>everyone</em> or <em>anyone</em> to stop using AI because that would be a kamikaze mission.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you think I’m right and need someone to talk to, I’m here.</p>
<h2 id="the-craft">The Craft</h2>
<p>As I’ve illustrated above, I love writing software. I love crafting nice tools and thinking of all the possible failure scenarios and ways to handle them in a way that it feels magic when things just continue to work. I love taking a pause to figure out that little annoying detail that just doesn’t feel right in a new API and figuring out the key to make it feels just right. I love writing clean package APIs so they flow naturally in user code. I love the feeling of connecting dots and things clicking to see all signs pointing to the most elegant addition to solve many problems. I even love spending all the extra time writing tests and making sure there’s a nice path to add more test cases without friction. I enjoy the puzzle of writing test with concurrency so that they are deterministic and reliable without hacks.</p>
<h2 id="ai-enters-the-chat">AI enters the chat</h2>
<p>When AI comes in as a tool claiming to generate all this “boring” boilerplate code for me, I don’t take it as good news. If AI really does take over doing that work, it’s also taking the most fun part of mine and leaving me with things I enjoy much less.</p>
<h2 id="the-weakening">The Weakening</h2>
<p>You might not agree or find as much pleasure in the craft as I do so that first point might seem weak to you. What might resonate with more is the weakening of muscles that we stop exercising. If AI takes over generating implementations, tests or even writing full apps for me, I’d be losing those muscles. Yes, I know, we can also assume AI will just do it better than I could and decide to go all-in. Have AI do all of it. Let’s not even worry about understanding what AI is producing for us. Maybe we can use the spare energy to build <em>new</em> muscles and skills and focus on building bigger and better things. The reality, however, might not be as great.</p>
<p><img src="https://heyitsalex.net/images/Motorola_4050a.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr"></p>
<p>Before I got a cellphone, I could remember my friends’ numbers. Now, I can remember my own number, my mother’s and my wife’s and&hellip;that’s it.</p>
<p><img src="https://heyitsalex.net/images/whatsthat.gif" alt="What&rsquo;s that?"></p>
<p>What’s that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forgotten the numbers from your two deceased friends, have you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that’s funny. It’s a fair thing to say that being older, I don’t have as many friends as I used to. I don’t know if I can blame technology for this. I bet I <em>might</em> be able to but it goes beyond the scope of this essay and what I’ve been pondering about so let’s table this for now.</p>
<p>The fact remains that I’ve got a lot more numbers saved in my phone’s contacts that I never even bothered to try and remember. I might not even have <em>read</em> the numbers once because it’s so easy to create a contact after getting the first call or text from someone. So the muscle that I could have been training to remember numbers is weak. You could speculate that I just made room in that brain of mine to remember other things. Hold on.</p>
<p><em>Google enters the chat</em>.</p>
<p>Why even bother to remember facts, recipes or stories when we can just look them up on demand by a quick google search? What about training our sense of directions and navigation when we’ve got those on our phones too? Or even why search for interesting content ourselves when we can get an endless stream of recommended content (see see the excellent video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA">Algorithms are breaking how we think</a>)? My point is that when things get easy, we lose the muscles and the satisfaction that comes from doing it the hard(er) way.</p>
<p><img src="https://heyitsalex.net/images/loseit.gif" alt="If you don&rsquo;t use it, you lose it"></p>
<h2 id="living-with-ourselves">Living With Ourselves</h2>
<p>Spencer Krug, thinker and poet from the Wolf Parade fame (especially if you’re music tastes are anchored in the 2006 indie music scene like mine), wrote a great track titled <a href="https://song.link/i/1615057883">How We Have to Live</a> that I now consider one of his best. Even though I never really bother going deep in song meaning and lyrics analysis, sometimes a line will stick with me. From that track, it’s the chorus that gets me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s how we have to live versus living with ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what Spencer Krug’s intent with those lyrics was but it doesn’t matter because it had a very specific meaning to me. We all have things to do that we don’t like in order to at least minimally comply and navigate this stressful and sometimes crazy world. <em>That</em> is how <em>we have to live</em>. But we also need to live in integrity with our principles and beliefs. We have to find a way to <em>live with ourselves</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I’m going to project a little bit here. Right now, AI is toned down and we’re reassured with the idea that it’s “just a tool” and not about to replace our jobs (or at least, we’ll still have <em>some</em> job). Jobs are one thing but the implied notion is that we’ll still be able to maintain our sense of identity. But if we squint a bit and listen in to the leaders of the AI and robotics movement, we can hear their promises and ambitions. Those include manifestation of a world where anything we might want or desire can be given to us cheaply (or freely?) because of AI and robotics. While it seems a bit of a stretch given finite resources, even the idea of that promise being manifested just partially worries me. If we can have anything and everything we want without effort, doesn’t all of it lose meaning?</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> cite behavioral science experiments but I prefer just asking you to do some introspection and use your intuition instead. I know my own most meaningful and valued experiences and accomplishments were the ones paved with struggles, sweat and effort. We tend to forget the overly safe, comfortable and easy. Behavioral science actually quantifies this by saying that we value the most those things that were <em>hard</em> and ended in success.</p>
<p>What about the value of something that required no effort? Could I live with myself knowing that I encouraged or even contributed to building a world without meaning?</p>
<p>For me, this means drawing a hard line at encouraging or using AI tools because I <em>couldn’t live with myself if I did</em>. I couldn’t live with the possibility, even remote, that I could help create a world that pushes a lot of us into a deep pit of despair.</p>
<p><img src="https://heyitsalex.net/images/andy-dwyer-andy-parksrec.gif" alt="Andy&rsquo;s pit of despair"></p>
<h2 id="blindly-we-go">Blindly We Go?</h2>
<p>AI and robotics are following the path we’ve been on for longer than recorded history. And because of it, it’s also the easiest direction to take. We’ve been creating technology to try and improve our lives or fix problems without realizing that the problems of the day came from the technology created to solve last year’s problems. It goes back more than the introduction of social networks and I’ll invite you to read <a href="https://www.ishmael.org/books/the-book/">Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael</a> trilogy for a big awakening.</p>
<p>When AI advocates compare generative AI to Photoshop, they are correct in highlighting the similarities. Before assuming that because Photoshop is kind of cool and a net positive, I’d like us to consider that <em>maybe</em> those prior advancements might not have been as clearly beneficial to us as we’ve framed them to be. You know, now that we’ve lost the ability and objectivity to imagine a world without them.</p>
<p>Consider foraging for food. Most modern people would say that they couldn’t even dream of surviving on hunting and foraging. They almost certainly wouldn’t <em>want</em> to. Agriculture and grocery stores are a clear advancement to human life, it would seem. But shouldn’t we also consider how those advancements also contributed to enabling easy access to <em>bad</em> food and abstracting away the provenance of our nourishment that we started doing it at a scale that was out of balance and destructive? Might there something to the reports of hunter-gatherers <a href="https://www.rewild.com/in-depth/leisure.html">having more leisure time</a> and living <a href="https://www.rewild.com/in-depth/longevity.html">longer and healthier lives</a>?</p>
<p>AI is a tool that has potential to intensity and accelerate our <em>disconnect</em> with the deeper connections with all living things. We’re already very deep into patterns of passive consumption and have delegated critical thinking to governments, corporations and assumed experts. With the quest for information being abstracted away behind AI summarized answers, we’re adding yet another abstraction that detaches us again from what could give us more meaning. It may sound hypocritical of a software engineer making a living from technology. Yes, I am “biting” the hand that feeds me. I know this well and it makes it hard sometimes for me to live with myself. Trying to break free and make an exit is a topic that me and many others are still exploring but it’s one that will take longer to solve.</p>

<h2 id="the-opportunity">The Opportunity</h2>
<p>I do believe that what we need, if we’re brave enough to consider it, is <em>less</em>. No to AI, no to social media, less internet, rare screen time. Instead, more time to get bored, time to get creative, time to wonder what this plant is, when fishing might be good, what our friends could be up to next week.</p>
<p>Personally, I would welcome big, if very different, disruptions. I’m not <em>waiting</em> for them and I know that I don’t have any agency to <em>make</em> them happen. Nonetheless, I’d be open to natural events leading us to <em>drop</em> technology and living with less safety and more adventure. Such a life, I think, would have a higher rewarding potential (even for a type 1 diabetic like me dependent on insulin). I’d be excited to reconnect with the essentials and spend hours outside foraging, splitting wood, tracking, fishing and have all the time in the world to live and enjoy all that’s real.</p>
