Title: Doing Beats Talking, Most of the Time
---

It has been a while since I last posted. I have no excuses; I simply have a good reason. 

I was *too busy*. 

I've been working on very exciting projects so that work consumed my time and energy enough that I didn't have time to *talk* about all what I was doing.

I'm still working on the same exciting things. But wait! I'm still here aren't I? I felt the need to come back and do something different (but still something *quick*). So here is a completely free to use wallpaper with an appropriate quote from none other than myself. Or could it be possible that someone else said that before I did and I just don't know? Nonsense! 

I'm sure you all agree that this is priceless? That's why I'm not putting a price on it.
