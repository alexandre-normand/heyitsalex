      <h1>The Tourist Photographer&#39;s Dilemma <span class="date">[July 27 2012]</span></h1>

       <div class="post content">
        <p>I wholeheartedly loathe tourist photos. I really do. I get angry just thinking about it. I really really hate this. Let me go outside and throw some rocks on a concrete wall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m back (I actually just grabbed a snack instead).</p>

<p>Let me first explain what I think is the problem with tourist photos: they&rsquo;re just too much. It&rsquo;s all inclusive. It has you, your kids, all of your magnificent landmark and it&rsquo;s surroundings. That kind of thing <em>never</em> works. Cameras should just pretend to be out of battery when faced with such a scene (they can recognizes <em>faces</em> already so that&rsquo;s possible right?).</p>


<figure class="full">
    
        <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7423/9349733524_71036a6a7c_h_d.jpg"  />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        This is a Boston landmark picture subtly showcasing the family. I&#39;m not terribly proud of it but I don&#39;t need to hide when people ask if I took it (I mean, if I were to hide, it would not be because of that).
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The reason it doesn&rsquo;t work is simple: a picture that has more than _one_ thing makes that one thing much more difficult to stand out. We all have different tastes and opinions. As such, you might disagree but let&rsquo;s just stop for a minute to look at pictures we like (I&rsquo;ll go do something better while you take a few moments and do it). I think you&rsquo;ll find that those are recurring patterns: shallow depth of field, uncoloured backgrounds, isolated subject, sharp focus. All of them have the same effect: make _one_ single thing stand out. Even ultra wide angles that seem to capture all of the surroundings produce great images when their focus is on making one thing stand out: the perspective.</p>

<p>Tourist photos are sickening because they do all the opposite. They cram people faking smiles on top of a very busy landmark scene.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re faced with this dilemma as photographers _and_ tourists:</p>

<ol>
<li>refuse to take the tourist snapshots and just take time to focus on quality work while pissing off everyone in the group</li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ol>
<li>take the snapshots the best you can with your big camera to take the touristy snapshots with better execution.
<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually not sure we can resolve this to the satisfaction of everyone involved (unless you&rsquo;re a family of photographers) but with a little effort, we can at least make an attempt. Or I tell you how and _you_ make the attempt. Just kidding, I&rsquo;m not letting <em>you</em> try this alone.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s try and make tourist pictures better. First, let&rsquo;s forget about showing off that you <em>were there in front of the golden bridge, omg!!</em> People are doing it everyday and you can just tweet it, we&rsquo;ll believe it. If we want to see the golden gate, we can google it and find fabulous shots that have been taken a thousand times.</p>

    <figcaption>
        One of my favorite touristy-type photos. I secretly waited for the good light while we were having fun and took this. Only regret: a stupid pole in the top-left corner of the frame I had to clumsily get rid of at post-processing.
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>I&rsquo;m not against using a landmark (or part of it) if it makes for a good picture though. A kid holding a coloured umbrella walking out of the fog on the golden gate bridge would be magnificent (I should do that shot before I start to think of the potential challenges involved). Let&rsquo;s just forget about taking pictures of you and ALL of that gigantic scene. Let&rsquo;s focus on isolated things. If you must take a picture with the statue of a president, make it a close up of yourself French kissing it. Want to capture yourself with the beautiful Apple store? Take a close shot of a reflection in it&rsquo;s recognizable glass walls.</p>

<p>Your job as the photographer (I know, it&rsquo;s not your job, it&rsquo;s just a hobby) is showing one interesting thing and removing everything else that gets in the way. Or at least, it&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>

<p>Well enough talk, now let&rsquo;s try this. Don&rsquo;t wait to be on vacation. Next time you&rsquo;re outside, go play tourist in your own hometown. That&rsquo;s something we always neglect anyway.</p>

<p>Maybe keep a <em>few</em> happy snapshots along the way as a peace offering.</p>

<p><em>Just in case.</em></p>
