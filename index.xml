        &lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/165946055/m%3D900/2f76e64f7f566065021c4843cb09b0dc&#34;  /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For months or probably even years, the question of where home is has been a nagging one. As we were migrating from one place to the other, we often felt lost with unfamiliar people and places.  But at the same time, we were learning about ourselves and clarifying what we&amp;rsquo;d desire from a environment and what we&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute back. After reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-War-Invasive-Species-Permaculture/dp/160358563X&#34;&gt;Beyond the War on Invasive Species&lt;/a&gt;, I now have a feeling that this migration process was more &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; that we thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the more time passes, the less any previous “home” qualifies as a native place for myself and my family. To this day, I can still say that I spent most of my life in Québec. And the place I’ve stayed the longest at is a small village Eastern of the province. But, looking back on the various stages of my life, it would be difficult to pretend that this small village is my native place. In some ways, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been since some of the key elements I’m looking for &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; were found in that place (and might still be) but the circumstances weren’t right and I was not right for that place at the time. I had to find another environment in which to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, since then, I’ve migrated and, one could say, became an invader. In some of those places I’ve migrated to, I changed. In a few of those, I think I might also have brought some change around me (maybe). And, as I look back on those patterns, I see parallels with my experience and invasive species in constantly changing ecosystems. I&amp;rsquo;m just another creature trying to find a good place that works for me and maybe bring something positive back to that place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I do a less than great job at contributing back to the places I visit than most &amp;ldquo;invasive&amp;rdquo; plants but I find comfort in knowing that I’m not necessarily forever lost for finding myself in a new and non-native place. The quest for a home is not stopping but it could become more interesting. Thinking of other living beings that become welcome additions to local ecosystems (at least by livings not fighting the war on invasives), I could now imagine myself having a similar role in a place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it might very well be that this place doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be one of my previous addresses for me to feel like I belong there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on Going Back</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/going-back/</link>

&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://500px.com/photo/119557113/sun-tree-camaraderie-by-alexandre-normand&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/119557113/m%3D900/66249bfc1d37efcb5453dec9c6e3a968&#34;  /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In challenging civilization, agriculture and technology, an objection, internal and/or external, almost inevitably pops up: we can’t &lt;em&gt;go back&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of smart people have pointed out that things change without a necessary progression or regression. Technology has made us think of change in terms of &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt;, as a one way road to always improving products. In actuality, changes can reveal themselves as good or bad and they can appear good for a time and become bad with a different context and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of change instead of progress can make some ideas appear more reasonable. But if you still think that we can’t escape &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt; and that we must find clever new technological solutions to the problems we continue to introduce, read this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the response to people who say you can&amp;rsquo;t go back&amp;hellip;well, what happens if you get to the cliff and you take one step forward&amp;hellip;or you make a 180° turn and then take one step forward? Which way are you going? Which way &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; progress?. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like how this provides an easy visual for our current trajectory and highlights the necessity to take a step back and look around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the most important critique of turning around revolves around the difficulty to feed the current human population. To this, I want to offer a quote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Against-Grain-Agriculture-Hijacked-Civilization/dp/0865477132&#34;&gt;Against the Grain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the human endeavor takes as its primary reason for being the feeding of however many people issue from the senseless acts of reproduction, then the human endeavor is pointless. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that Richard Manning does not clearly suggest a solution but this idea rings true, even if it makes us feel uncomfortable. If we agree that our current ways have little point, it would appear relevant to really consider taking a 180 turn. Or maybe we could take a less than 180 degrees turn if we think that the cliff is far enough ahead of us. But it becomes very hard to deny the need for a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that new path, we might find that the population will normalize itself with less drama than if we just run off the cliff. We might rediscover meaning in our connection with the non technological world. We might find a point to life in acts of regeneration, repairs and grief. And we might do so even if our speed does not allow us to stop in time before we reach the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about taking this turn?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Longing for Belonging</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/longing-for-belonging/</link>

    &lt;a href=&#34;https://500px.com/photo/131336963/frosted-stones-by-alexandre-normand&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/131336963/m%3D900/dffeafcaa64e60df7de6c06c32b204fa&#34;  /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I define belonging as elements that you feel a gravitational force pulling you towards. Such elements include family, people, language, land, place, plants, animals and, even, work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forever sedentaries have a better chance, but no guarantees, to find those elements coming together nicely in a single geographical location. But some people have felt a force pulling them away from their geographical home/land/family in a quest to find some of those missing elements. “World travelers”,as some call them, might have a hard time when the inevitable questioning arises: where do I belong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, that same craving for belonging might have driven, intentional or not, that desire to travel. And the travel/relocation offers a unique perspective and opportunity to discover things about oneself, connect dots and discover new ideas. But it also, paradoxically, requires giving up some of the elements that define a sense of belonging (namely: land, place, family and, sometimes, language).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That process has played an instrumental role in my discovery of some fundamental wrongs of our culture and some of the uncomfortable illusions we entertain in regards to the solutions for a good future. That process has accelerated my  discovery of what makes &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and how I want to play a role in this connected world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where do I belong? Who do I belong with? I don’t know. To complicate things further, the answer might be different for the members of my immediate family. As “world travelers”, we’re faced with the possibility that most logical option might involve choosing a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe spending some more time searching and finding what constitutes the true essence of our belonging will expose new and fuller alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Living in the Moment or Not</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/in-the-moment-or-not/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2015 10:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/in-the-moment-or-not/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living in the moment seems like a very serene way of living. A very buddhist perspective free from the worries of the past and the future. One path to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I find it incredibly difficult to live in the moment. I guess my reasons are commonplace and typical which makes me a very average being. I find it difficult because I’m worried. It’s hard because I think about the future. It’s impossible because I think of what I should be doing rather than what I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also think there’s more to it. It’s possible that this is just my way of finding an excuse but I think that we might not have the luxury of living in the moment. We&amp;rsquo;re the privileged ones on top of this civilized world with no or very little conscience of the damage we&amp;rsquo;re inflicting on all living things. After having played the role of evil in this story for so long, can we really afford to live this moment? Maybe it would be a good idea &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; but I think the focus in this time of near collapse would be better served by reading the past and imagining a future of redemption and regeneration. I can&amp;rsquo;t be enjoying myself right now because this life and therefore this moment has been made possible by acts of destruction and disrespect for life. Living that moment would just go in support of this and it&amp;rsquo;s a hard choice to make when you&amp;rsquo;ve reached a certain level recognition for what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in pain and absent mindedness because I think of the terrible destruction started by my ancestors that I&amp;rsquo;m perpetuating implicitly by living this life. I stare at the emptiness thinking of a life I could be living in accordance to my views. Oh sure, I can occasionally distract myself for temporary relief but, more generally, I think it would be too easy to live comfortably in this moment sponsored by terrible destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

        Frozen Maple Leaf. This proved to be one of those distractions that, for a few minutes, provided relief from constantly thinking about the past or the future. I think.

      <title>The Barrier of Isolation</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/the-barrier-of-isolation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 09:20:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/the-barrier-of-isolation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are many barriers to rewilding but I’d like to tackle one today. I realize that my perspective is one of a priviledged white man but I can’t pretend it’s any other way and I just feel the need to share. Thanks for reading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/119443369/m%3D900/fb6bda485505dc2a922d626fde2e1769&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        A Bite.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My family and I moved in 2012 on my quest to find meaning in my work (or, incidentally, my &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;). If we already suffered an isolated life before the move, it wasn’t worse than most priviledged modern families. Of course that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean much as our modern world pushes us further and further away from each other. Still, we had friends, family and we even talked to some of our neighbors (!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost some of that when we landed in California. As time passed, we did get to know some people: mostly me through work and Flavie through school. After 3 years, we moved to Portland because of my SF tech overdose, the ridiculousness of it all (alluding to the rent prices and the water shortage would barely scratch the surface) but also because there seemed to be a focus in Portland on things that that started coming in focus for ourselves: unschooling, rewilding, nature and health. But with remote work and unschooling, we again hit a bump on the isolation road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to what I really wanted to say: the more we move closer to our uncommon convictions, the more we might feel isolated. In other words, the more we move away from a system that we can’t support anymore, the harder it seems to become to stay connected with people that still fully support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, I think, is one significant barriers to rewilding for some. Or so it appears initially. While it’s easy to continue having casual conversations with colleagues and friends who don’t currently share the same views, it feels like a lie by ommission to avoid talking about rewilding. Because, truthfully, everything can be connected to the desire for civilization to collapse, for our place to be restored in nature, for our regenerative work to begin. But there are some people that would turn off completely if exposed to these ideas prematurely. And skipping on those discussions seems to me like just another form of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe it doesn’t have to be that way. Maybe it’s just a matter of choosing the right words. Most people, deep down, aren’t happy with their life and that opens up a discussion about &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; better. For a relative newcomer to the ideas of rewilding like me, it might even be easier to relate to people who are uninitiated rather than the teachers who are so further ahead. It might not be as satisfactory as getting to the core of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we should tackle everything that needs to be done but it seems like an important part. With the benefit that there’s a potential for reaching out to more people and even strenghtening relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All said, I believe the reality might be an unelegant mix. I can’t help but feel the need to break away from this isolation bubble by interacting with like-minded folks. It seems &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; realistic that some some form of rewilding discussions can happen with friends who are not currently thinking of rewilding or just not thinking of rewilding in the same terms and definitions. It seems unrealistic that this can be fully satisfactory. I’ve said it before but it seems as relevant today than when I wrote this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heyitsalex.net/new-light-on-that-blue&#34;&gt;long ago&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not sure friends are forever but we forever needs friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, ideally, some of those friends would be passionate rewilders because it’s a topic that we can’t really pause from thinking about for very long.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Positive Optimism</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/positive-optimism/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/positive-optimism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I felt lost when I wrote my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heyitsalex.net/negative-optimism&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; regarding the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction&#34;&gt;Holocene extinction&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I had just learned that our species had a destructive nature since its inception even &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_generation_sustainability&#34;&gt;within cultures focusing on sustainability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now think that I had misinterpreted my readings. Whether intentional or not, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Extinction-Unnatural-History/dp/1250062187/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1446433599&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=The+Sixth+Extinction&#34;&gt;The Sixth Extinction&lt;/a&gt; implied with the retelling of conversations about the history of homo sapiens that destruction had followed the path of our species from our early beginnings. However, after some more researching, it appears that, while there were extinctions before civilization, those were not quite at the same level nor within the same context. I already had some intuition to that effect and I felt relief to find some of that evidence presented in &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/rewildandlive&#34;&gt;Rewild 101&lt;/a&gt;. Civilization would have amplified our destructive impact by orders of magnitude. However, I now think that extinctions prior to civilization were closer to events that would occur naturally as part of evolution and cohabitation between other species. We can &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; bad about those but they should reveal themselves as neither good or bad. In contract with current extinctions, those represent something closer to a natural outcome to a particular set of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this new perspective doesn’t really change the idea that we should rewild and reconnect with nature, it does offer us an interesting proposition: we could have a positive place amongst other livings. That process might involve a lot of hardships and it won’t happen quickly but the idea that it could brings me joy here and now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Negative Optimism</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/negative-optimism/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2015 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/negative-optimism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a snapshot in a continuous exploration of the meaning of life and our place in nature. All thoughts and ideas expressed here are subject to change at any moment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas evolve and change. Or, at least, they usually do. When I picked up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Sixth-Extinction-Unnatural-History/dp/0805092994&#34;&gt;The Sixth Extinction&lt;/a&gt;, I had a sense that I might not get much new to advance my current ideas. I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My skepticism seem warranted when, reading the introduction, it appeared as if the book was about the telling of a great story first and foremost. But while that might have been the author’s  initial motivation, she made a convincing case that even if she might have been looking for a story, it might just happen to be one that is incredibly captivating because of its importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Extinction, also named the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction&#34;&gt;holocene extinction&lt;/a&gt;, is the one we&amp;rsquo;re currently experiencing. There are many intuitive ways we can imagine ourselves playing a role in extinctions that globally make this one up: climate change, GMOs, surpopulation, overfishing. All of which are fairly recent on a geologic time scale. Going back just a little bit further, we could think that agriculture, civilization and colonization could have been immensely destructive. That would also be very right. It was and it remains more so than anything else. As we go back further though, it gets increasingly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; surprised to find more evidence that our hunter gatherers ancestors might also have been causing mass extinctions. What follows is based on very incomplete research is incomplete and only partial data. Also consider that we got facts about history wrong many times before. So, with the data that we currently have, it would seem like extinctions started with the homo sapiens. Before homo sapiens, neanderthals seemed to be doing well on Earth. It remains to be explored what was so different between neanderthals and homo sapiens but it would seem that ingenuity, creativity and ambition were qualities that could have had a major factor in newly occurring destruction. Or maybe it was our ability to tell ourselves stories, deal with virtual/abstract things (i.e. money, religion) and collaborate together based on those stories. Or maybe it was a deep and constant appetite for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colonizing remote continents is one obvious way homo sapiens have impacted ecosystems and caused harm. But it&amp;rsquo;s also very obvious how the same traits are still causing us to destroy faster and more decisively by the day. The same homo sapiens quality that is making me want to write about this idea is contributing to us to destroy our environment. This was a deep revelation for me, as a self-qualified &amp;ldquo;creative&amp;rdquo; person. What the planet would need, it seems, is boring and predictable species. Ones that are content living in equilibrium in their habitat. But this is fundamentally not how homo sapiens are. And very disappointingly, native tribes are not immune to this. It follows that rewilding ourselves might not be the saving grace. It &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be going in the right direction: using less resources and being more connected to nature can only be good. It would most definitely be a better life for most of us urban folks. But I doubt it would be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that this is a hard conclusion to come to and it might appear awfully negative. I guess it is. But only if we view it purely in the lens that &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;human life&lt;/em&gt;. If we try to view human life as just another form of life, there’s optimism. Because, with the bringing of the Sixth Extinction, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that one of the species going extinct is going to be the homo sapiens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is that optimistic? Well, let’s talk about the common “optimistic” scenario for a constrast. One common suggested alternative is that the human &amp;ldquo;ingenuity&amp;rdquo; gives us a solution. Imagine technological means to explore and settle on a new planet. Throw the Earth away and take our &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; to a new world. This, to me, is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; pessimistic scenario. After destroying all life on Earth, we&amp;rsquo;d get to do it all over on another world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now what? I&amp;rsquo;m going to bet that we don&amp;rsquo;t survive the Sixth Extinction. I&amp;rsquo;m going to bet that several resilient or lucky species do. I&amp;rsquo;m going to bet that with enough time, evolution will take its course and new species with pop up. The Earth will find a new balance again. Life will strive and the Earth will be a nice home again. Maybe a new species of bipeds like the Neanderthals will appear. A smart biped ape that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be inflicted by the urge to realize bigger dreams than just living in symbiosis with its environment. That, to me, is the optimistic scenario. That&amp;rsquo;s the one I&amp;rsquo;m betting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that betting against my own species could be considered trahison. But if we just think of ourselves as one member of a larger group that is &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rdquo;, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as terrible of an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, how this affects how I live now gets a bit more complicated. We all want to live. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; still want to live. I&amp;rsquo;d like to move in the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; direction but it becomes very confusing as to what this could be. Another way to look at it would be that as we&amp;rsquo;re going extinct, I should just find a quiet space to reflect in the meantime. A life closer to nature. Try to find solace knowing that when we won&amp;rsquo;t be there, some of this nature and some of this life will actually be able to strive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe that&amp;rsquo;s it. It might be time to come to peace with the resolution that we screwed up. Come to terms with the idea that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are the problem. Saying our final good byes before we go the way of the dodo. And know, that maybe, probably, there will still be life after us and that life will be smart enough to not try and get too smart to disturb a fragile and beautiful equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, this might also be a bump in the road to a brighter, continuously evolving set of thoughts and ideas where we’d be a force for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Back to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heyitsalex.net/positive-optimism&#34;&gt;positive optimism&lt;/a&gt; with new information after digging into pre-history. Read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heyitsalex.net/positive-optimism&#34;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt; for my current thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Big Illusions</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/the-big-illusions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2015 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/the-big-illusions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I closed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Ratchet-Humanity-Thrives/dp/0465044972&#34;&gt;The Big Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; mad with rage. I wasn’t surprised to find myself in disagreement with the author but I did find myself unable to contain my emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While venting, I realized what frustrated me. The author goes into the history of humanity and its “ingenuity”. She goes on to tell the story of “pivots” in history. Along the way, tragedies happen (indigenous people are exterminated, species disappear and sustainable ways of life are destroyed) but they’re always brushed off very quickly as minor downsides of something that brought a net positive. Each time, she tells us that out of the problems that we introduced, we found solutions that made us better than when we started. And, in every case, I found myself offended that she would say that. In every case, I was thinking to myself that we had just taken a wrong turn that should have prompted us to turn back. Instead, we celebrated an illusion of progress that was bringing us deeper into a path of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple times, she goes on to say that we were better because more people had food, we could expand and considering going back would be impossible because of all the life that needed to be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But which life? The fact is that she equals “life” with &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; life. More precisely, the modern civilized human. What about all the life that we, empire people, ended up killing the process? What about the species that go extinct every day? She shows a profound denial of what life truly is. Life is everywhere and it relies on the balance we so obviously disturbed and now try to control. Would going back to hunting and gathering mean widespread famine? Likely. But would this be a net loss for life? I’m not so sure. All signs point to a potential for better balance. In the process, it would bring a long lost humility to our species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also probably mean that I’d be one of the casualties given my dependence on modern drugs for my disease of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say what I would decide for humanity if I was asked to. Would I go for the continuity, hoping we’d find remedies to all of the ill we’re inflicting on our world and ourselves? Or would I go for turning back, knowing this would bring the demise of myself and countless others who exist or continue to exist with dependence on modernity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like an easy decision. There’s hope that human ingenuity might bring us to unimaginable territories and there’s  no chance I could live without the modern civilization as a type 1 diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am, in theory, in favour for turning back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the days, week or month of that life that I’d get back living connected to other life might be worth it. I’d hope that my fear of death would carry a lighter weight in the balance next to the possibility of life &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the planet rather than as a farmer of its resources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uncertainties</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/uncertainties/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know that I know nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a famous saying that resonates profoundly these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe in sudden triggering factors outside of our reflex for self-biography narration but I will surrender and say that 2013 was a markedly transformative year in my life. That’s when I radically changed my lifestyle to try and fix my degrading type 1 diabetic health. I had already learned about the effectiveness of simple behavioural science principles to power my commitment to make change happen.  I felt the benefits very quickly. In less than 6 months, I had started the reversal of early signs of retinopathy. But I had also learned that things weren’t so simple in nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 2013 was when I learned that I had trusted the wrong sources about nutrition and health more generally. What else did I assumed as universal truth but wasn’t? 18 months later, I’m still wondering what’s the best diet for me. I learned that there isn’t one solution that fits everyone. I’ve also learned about several things that affect health but, more importantly, I learned that it’s only a tiny fraction of what there is to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I also learned about rewilding. I then learned that rewilding means different things to different people. I learned some of its definitions. I learned about new ideas on waste, consumption and the economy religion. I learned about tiny housing and a minimalistic way of life. None of it is simple. There are some very compelling perspective on the modern life but there’s also no clear and unique solution and path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m sitting here bombarded with very assertive statements and solutions to achieve health, accomplishment, happiness and financial freedom. But I also know things are complicated and personal. There’s rarely a single answer. There’s a lot of information to process and lots of questions to pounder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post isn’t about how to be creative, productive, healthy or happy. I wouldn’t know what to prescribe because it’s complicated. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about how everything is fucked and there&amp;rsquo;s no solution. Even if that were true, we woulnd&amp;rsquo;t know until we try something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I&amp;rsquo;m uncertain what this post is about. But maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what the theme. My search for my very own personal answers is full of uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while uncertainties that can be paralyzing, there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I do know and that it&amp;rsquo;s nice things usually happen when you try something different. If nothing more than ruling out an idea while prompting a fresh set of questions and opening up new paths to answers. Here&amp;rsquo;s to finding the next path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doing Beats Talking, Most of the Time</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/doing-beats-talking-most-of-the-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2013 10:53:03 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/doing-beats-talking-most-of-the-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I last posted. I have no excuses; I simply have a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;em&gt;too busy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on very exciting projects so that work consumed my time and energy enough that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; about all what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the same exciting things. But wait! I&amp;rsquo;m still here aren&amp;rsquo;t I? I felt the need to come back and do something different (but still something &lt;em&gt;quick&lt;/em&gt;). So here is a completely free to use wallpaper with an appropriate quote from none other than myself. Or could it be possible that someone else said that before I did and I just don&amp;rsquo;t know? Nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you all agree that this is priceless? That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m not putting a price on it. You are free to use, modify and pretty much do anything you&amp;rsquo;d like with this as long as you give me the credit and it fits under the terms of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Juxtapose</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/juxtapose/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 05:58:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/juxtapose/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I came across some stunning &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgur.com/a/wxBBm#0&#34;&gt;compositing work&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://realcalvinandhobbes.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;Michael Den Beste&lt;/a&gt;. The project juxtaposes drawings of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes&#34;&gt;Calvin and Hobbes&lt;/a&gt; with fitting nature photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By themselves, the photos would be pretty good albeit lacking a distinguishing element. With Calvin and Hobbes, the scene comes alive. The drawings bring a touch of imagination in an otherwise very real scene. I felt as if the world was being filled with mystical creatures from storybooks. It&amp;rsquo;s breaking the monotony of a thousand pretty pictures while celebrating of the beauty of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell I felt inspired by that work. I also happen to take random unpublished pictures suited for such compositing work: &lt;em&gt;wallpaper-nice&lt;/em&gt; caliber but nothing crazy unique. I also happen to draw things. Or, I try to. Here is my first attempt at this type of composite art. It&amp;rsquo;s an old pouring rain picture that I augmented with my drawing of a snail. I have much better photos in reserve for this type of work but this one seemed to be fitting with my character so I&amp;rsquo;m going with that. Uncharacteristically for me, this won&amp;rsquo;t be a scheduled project. But, I&amp;rsquo;ll make more.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8234/8508412905_e34d5b1429_b.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        This is it.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;techdetails&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical details:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Original picture processed with Aperture, exported via Dropbox to iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I drew the a low-resolution version of the snail with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fiftythree.com/paper&#34;&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt; on the iPad and my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tenonedesign.com/connect.php&#34;&gt;Pogo Connect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Then, I exported to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.procreate.si/&#34;&gt;Procreate&lt;/a&gt; and used it as the basis for a higher resolution and full color version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Composited the photo and drawing in Procreate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That output was then tweaked with snapseed for drama and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-touch.html&#34;&gt;Photoshop Touch&lt;/a&gt; to add the horizontal black border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Love Letter to Github</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/love-letter-to-github/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 06:07:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/love-letter-to-github/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;figure class=&#34;medium&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://alexandrenormand.users.sonic.net/heyitsalex.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Octocalex-2012-12-16-07.49.31-168-PM1.png&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        I&amp;#39;m really sorry about this. I wanted an image and I thought drawing myself octocat-style would be cool. I guess it could have been if I had done a better job. For the record, I blame the tools. No SketchBook Ink for me next time.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have one thing I want to say today: I love &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this would just barely be worthy of a tiny tweet (and not even a _good_ one), I&amp;rsquo;m going to stretch this as far as I can to get to a blog post length. Just because I feel like blogging today. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s just how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past week was really great. Don&amp;rsquo;t you care to know why? Well, fine, I&amp;rsquo;m telling anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with me just trying to get some data on the distribution of the data across regions in hbase. I thought it was something we should be looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enters &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sentric/hannibal&#34;&gt;Hannibal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few minutes, I had cloned it, built it and had it running against one of our clusters. The visuals are really good and it definitely increases our ability to quickly see where we&amp;rsquo;re at compared to a text output (which can also be done pretty easily with an hbase shell script).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this running instance on our data quickly came the realization that we&amp;rsquo;d use this for real. And, like, &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On closer look, I noticed issues with getting compaction logs. Also, I started thinking of some things we might tweak to make it easier to have this deployed and running internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the details of the changes involved. The &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; is really the topic I had in mind when sitting down to write this. Or rather the lack thereof really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice? I just lied straight to your face and I knew you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t budge. Actually, there _is_ a process but Github makes it all so easy and fun that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like the drag we so often associate with processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how this lays out: You read about this thing or google your way to it. You need this thing and someone already wrote it. It starts here and then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clone, build, run and use the thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something missing or that could use some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You feel the urge to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the critical part right there. It&amp;rsquo;s often where things &lt;em&gt;get complicated&lt;/em&gt;. You might need to file a ticket first with steps to reproduce. You might need to sell people of that feature you think _should definitely_ be in the scope of the project. You know, it&amp;rsquo;s complicated™. But Github helps. Let&amp;rsquo;s get on with how this goes with it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You fork it. A one click step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do the work. And it&amp;rsquo;s the most fun part. You&amp;rsquo;re excited because this is something that bugged &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s something _you_ care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done with the changes? Now it&amp;rsquo;s pull requesta extravaganza! This is when you get to show off the interesting work you&amp;rsquo;ve cared so much about. Also, because it&amp;rsquo;s cool to work with people excited about your project, interesting discussions follow. Meeting new folks. You know, _talking_ (or, more accurately, &lt;em&gt;typing&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just describing one scenario here but let&amp;rsquo;s say everything is right and your changes were merged into the upstream repo. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this feel &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;? It&amp;rsquo;s almost silly but I just feel like a little boy and I want to show mommy how proud I am of the thing I just did. Even for a one line change. I&amp;rsquo;d like to show the whole world about this thing I just did. Please refrain though. People will run away screaming if you do this too often. And maybe even the first time you do it. So, please, don&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You just feel like smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, you can get the same great rewarding feeling from contributing to any open source project even if that&amp;rsquo;s not hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. But the entry barrier is just a little bit higher. It takes more time. Some of that precious and limited energy that you have is spent on the _other_ stuff that, well, isn&amp;rsquo;t as much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything to make the process so easy it just seems to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exist is an amazing feat. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; really enables tons of changes (okay, I just made that up but I really think it&amp;rsquo;s a good uneducated guess) by just making a path available from discovering a personal need to getting it done. Github is empowering people to fix it &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;. And we all know how momentum is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I won&amp;rsquo;t shock anyone if I say we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go back to a world without &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. More than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;, Github really brings the _develop with pleasure_ motto to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Github, I love you. Never leave me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        My old days of listening to music.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We&amp;rsquo;ve got all you music. Surrender a fee and it&amp;rsquo;s yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a ransom note from a villain. It&amp;rsquo;s not. This is the promise of music services like &lt;a href=&#34;http://rdio.com/&#34;&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spotify.com/&#34;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling hesitant when the digital age began. I liked putting my favourite albums on display. After some time, I realized that I never actually looked at them and it was just more _stuff_ to carry around. I slowly stopped buying physical CDs. This was liberating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the iTunes age. I would buy albums and store them in a nice folder that kept growing. Backed up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.backblaze.com/&#34;&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; too. However, I now look at some of this music and I&amp;rsquo;ve either listened it to death or I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind about it. In all cases, most of the time, I just listen to the more recent great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last part has been a problem for me in the last few years. You know how it is. When you become a dad, you&amp;rsquo;ve got less free time. I know some dads that are still up-to-date on the latest great music but I think you&amp;rsquo;ve got only a few picks to make when you&amp;rsquo;ve got less free time. I chose photography and software. I had to give up on music. Thankfully, some of the bands I was listening to are still doing some innovative work so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t  _completely _out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved this year, I also decided to try to get back into it a bit more. Ideally without having to put too much time into it. My priorities hadn&amp;rsquo;t changed. I tried &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spotify.com/&#34;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pandora.com/&#34;&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have such a good experience with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spotify.com/&#34;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I had access to a huge selection, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to look for. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pandora.com/&#34;&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt; was definitely better in that regard. I could use something I knew as a reference and get a radio station with potentially good picks. That was unsatisfying to me though. When you stumble on a great track and want to listen to more of that band, you&amp;rsquo;re left on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&#34;http://rdio.com/&#34;&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt;. After reading good words about it, I decided give the trial a try. I liked it. I still do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I had access to playlists that were a great starting point (like pitchfork&amp;rsquo;s best songs). Then, as I discovered things I liked, I could add bands and albums to my collection and even synchronize them to my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s all I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy discovery with trusted curated content and access to an exhaustive music library. Sure, I have to pay every month. But, one month of &lt;a href=&#34;http://rdio.com/&#34;&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt; is the price of a single album on iTunes. Yes, I lose it all if I decide to cancel. When you think about it though, that music I was listening to a few months ago isn&amp;rsquo;t really what I&amp;rsquo;m going to want to listen to in two months anyway. Also, if I were to find another solution, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have the same music there anyway. And if not, that&amp;rsquo;s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really cool thing about all of this though goes beyond easy access to music: No more &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing to carry around. This is definitely more liberating that the jump to the digital age. This is acknowledging that we change and we might not have to keep all of our things from the past with us because we cherished it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have stuff I&amp;rsquo;m carrying along with me, way _too_ much. I know. Hopefully though, this stuff is now more of my own creations (or my creation tools) than stuff I acquire. Not ideal, but better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Still Remember, Even After 6 Months</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/i-still-remember-even-after-6-months/</link>

        &lt;img src=&#34;http://alexandrenormand.users.sonic.net/heyitsalex.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JeMeSouviensVersion2Landscape-1024x522.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        I remember. Well, at least, what I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: the initial version was way too purple on print. It did look fine on my iPhone screen but the print was definitely not blue, especially when under indoor lights. The guys at gelaskin were kind enough to give me another one for free that I could do with an updated version of the image. This is what you&amp;rsquo;re seeing here. I changed the blue to something that I felt was a safer bet (and better looking to). They looked at it before shipping and they did confirm it looked blue&amp;hellip;for real this time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a well-known fact that lack of sunlight affects mood. I know this to be true but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to tell ourselves we&amp;rsquo;re just too strong to feel the influence of something so out of our control as this distant sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that the sun does help. But the sun is shy in San Francisco during what we conventionally call &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo;. Most of the time, the fog is king. Obviously, the closer you get to the coast, the worse it is (or the better it is if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for atmospheric fog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there&amp;rsquo;s September. People say the fog magically leaves by September. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a big lie. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some of the thickest fog this September and we barely had any sun. I can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure if it&amp;rsquo;s an anomaly but if someone tells you September is never foggy here, it&amp;rsquo;s a blatant lie. This year was the proof (oh, isn&amp;rsquo;t fun to prove a proposition by a single contradiction?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came October. And now, oh boy, did October deliver. It was great. Not _too _hot but &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; right (except for that one time where it was &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too hot but that lasted like just one second). Along with the first days of October came the sun and it felt great. You might be like me and love seeing nature&amp;rsquo;s force in action (snowstorms, pouring rain, thunder, thick fog) but we need the sun. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so much before but I do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I remember Montreal. I know, it&amp;rsquo;s been only 6 months or so since we left. You know how it is though. As you leave a place, you start feeling the ties more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this manifested in an odd manner. I felt like I should show my identity (as if people can&amp;rsquo;t tell from the way I talk). That&amp;rsquo;s a tricky thing. I&amp;rsquo;m not one to just dress myself with a flag or hang it by the window. But then, there had been this thing I had seen and liked for its looks but didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel right: a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gelaskins.com/store/phones/iPhone_4/O_Canada&#34;&gt;Canadian flag skin&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone. There was also the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gelaskins.com/store/phones/iPhone_4/Stars_and_Stripes&#34;&gt;United States flag&lt;/a&gt;, not right either. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gelaskins.com/store/phones/iPhone_4/Union_Jack&#34;&gt;UK flag&lt;/a&gt;? Even worse. You can guess the rest of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you can&amp;rsquo;t? Well, I made my own gelaskin. My Quebec flag gelaskin. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would actually use it if I were still living in Quebec but here? I like the idea. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve said in the past that cases and screen protectors are &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m making a compromise here. A gelaskin isn&amp;rsquo;t actually a case: it should not add much perceptible thickness to my phone and it&amp;rsquo;s not covering any of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it? Feel free to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://heyitsalex.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JeMeSouviensVersion2.jpg&#34;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; to make your own. Or just try it to see how it looks using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gelaskins.com/create&#34;&gt;gelaskin&amp;rsquo;s custom skin creator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        The Real Thing.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is not Montreal. Talking specifically about weather (yep, this has been my great weather post!), we won&amp;rsquo;t get the great snowstorms of Montreal&amp;rsquo;s winter. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s always the same though. It might seem like it is sometimes. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday: same forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day, it&amp;rsquo;s different. One day, there&amp;rsquo;s that pouring rain threatening a Giants game or that thicker fog that completely erases the view. And sometimes, there&amp;rsquo;s the sun and it&amp;rsquo;s rays shinning on through the leaves, bouncing off windows to come and tickle our senses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Light on that Blue</title>
      <link>http://www.heyitsalex.net/new-light-on-that-blue/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Aug 2012 10:00:21 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.heyitsalex.net/new-light-on-that-blue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;*What follows is my take on &lt;a href=&#34;http://heyitsalex.net/what-can-happen-in-a-second/&#34;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; prompt from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Things-Journal-Francisco-Writers-Grotto/dp/1452105448&#34;&gt;642 Things to Write About&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty personal, borderline personal diary. Yeah.
Since this blog is my miscellaneous bucket and I&amp;rsquo;m the editor, I say it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s ship it. Then, see how it feels.
Do not worry, I&amp;rsquo;m not planning on making regular posts about my feelings, probably.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So here it is, my take on this prompt:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What a character holding a blue object is thinking about?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I was, holding a blue pen. I had just lost my train of thought. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly looking at it so much as this was an out of focus blue spot. Not any blue either. It was a blue recalling Québec&amp;rsquo;s national blue. I always felt pretty neutral with that particular hue. I always loved blue but I disliked this particular one, much to my chagrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today though, this blue is reminiscent of what we&amp;rsquo;ve left behind. We always knew it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be easy to relocate. The nice things about California are indeed &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; but it&amp;rsquo;s not so much like we weren&amp;rsquo;t happy with Montréal. This story isn&amp;rsquo;t one of a quest for the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/14092047/m%3D900/374628c29b6de4a859eb8bcdb6dbf069&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        There&amp;#39;s that theme of being somewhere else, shot by me in the Golden Gate Park woods.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some days, we read about cool things that are happening right here, only here. Those days, I feel very fortunate to be here. Other days, we read about some interesting change happening in Montréal and we feel like we&amp;rsquo;re missing out. This is a very typical case of nostalgia versus novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is relatively minor though, in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything, except one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can do with a slower public transit system.
I can deal with a more complex health care system.
I can accept living in a less lively neighbourhood.
I am however having a real hard time not having friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What friends I hear you thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many. I had to make sacrifices when it became obvious that, as a parent, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to do all I was doing before. Friendship took second place to personal projects and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that this is oversimplifying. I still had friends. I was seeing some of them almost exclusively at the office but they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be easy to make new friends. I was anticipating that the English speaking version of me would be struggling to find the words to express nuanced thoughts. It would be more difficult to be &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it would be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it harder than I thought it would be? Maybe not. But having anticipated it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any easier to deal with, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also very much neglected the difficulty in coordinating talking with friends in Eastern time. We&amp;rsquo;re living in an always connected world after all, aren’t we? It could be easier if I didn&amp;rsquo;t care so much about my work but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s what I came here for and I do love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no happy revelation here. No words of wisdom. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make a new friend just today that made everything all better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things that will incrementally get better over time. I suppose. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure friends are forever but you could say that we forever needs friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I see this blue pen today and it appears in this newly rediscovered grandiose hue.&lt;/p&gt;
