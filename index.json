      "content_html": "\u003cdiv class=\"interlude\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eFollowing the phone’s directions, we hop off the bus at 23rd and look North to find that the road is interrupted. There’s a small but steep hill without sidewalk or road. We proceed with caution and find the road and sidewalk resuming a few hundred feet later. The kids didn’t want to make the trip with me and now they have ammunition to highlight my poor judgement. We walk several more blocks in what is definitely \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e a pedestrian friendly street. Some lack a sidewalk, with the space taken up for truck or car parking to commercial storage places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe eventually reach the address of the recycling place but it’s not obvious where we should go. We try going inside first and the lady at the front desk directs us to the side of the building where there’s a truck with collected items. Two guys are busy unloading but one sees us and I tell them I have a few items to drop off: some light bulbs, some alkaline batteries, some smaller cell batteries and a few broken electronics. On seeing what isn’t a huge amount of them, he tells me that the fee is per pound with a minimum charge of 1 pound. He visibly expects me to give up on hearing this warning as I obviously have fractions of that but going back home with the items isn\u0026rsquo;t an option I\u0026rsquo;m willing to consider. I pay the fee but only after I help the guy calculate the total of what I owe him since he’s struggling with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI leave with a feeling of having done something that ordinary people like us rarely do. I also feel like I’ve overpaid for having good conscience but I also wonder if they actually do properly recycle the stuff. What if I’m paying them to carry the heavy burden of putting the toxicity back in the land? We head back home talking about how difficult recycling is and how important it is to try and avoid the problem by using less. I listen to myself and I feel bad that I\u0026rsquo;m withholding my opinion that \u0026ldquo;consuming less\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t really a realistic solution in the current world we live in. We need something more radical than \u0026ldquo;using less\u0026rdquo; but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like this is the time to bring this up and I think it\u0026rsquo;s still important to try and reduce our consumption. I’m uncertain if the kids are understanding what I’m trying to teach but I do think that the experience of getting there will be something they remember. And maybe that’s enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been through another move recently. As with all of our previous moves, we went through a pruning phase and sorted out the junk from the keepers. And with each move, we get better at knowing what we \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e and it gets a little easier. That is, except for one thing: recycling the things that broke, wore out or have gone past their expiration date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not a piece aiming to give resources about what to do and how to recycle everything. Solutions do exist for most things but they vary significantly depending on where you live. However, everywhere we’ve been to, there\u0026rsquo;s one commonality: recycling is rarely easy beyond the few accepted items at the city-level waste/recycling companies. In most cases, it\u0026rsquo;s really difficult and in some cases, it\u0026rsquo;s just impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI suspect that this difficulty could be partly explained by our disconnect from where \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; come from. We now have many abstractions that make it easier to design, produce and sell items. People extract raw materials, others process them to enable their use in manufacturing, designers imagine and draw a product, parts are built according to specs by workers somewhere and, finally, assembly is probably handled by yet another group. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m forgetting steps or misrepresenting parts of the process but the idea should be obvious: by adopting those attractions, we\u0026rsquo;ve made the production of more complex technology possible while also removing ourselves from the source of the materials and processes involved in making \u003cem\u003estuff\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of whether or not there\u0026rsquo;s truth in this hypothesis, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to argue that recycling isn\u0026rsquo;t difficult. It\u0026rsquo;s very challenging for anyone to find the proper way to recycle stuff and sometimes the few alternatives are not easily accessible, especially for individuals. At the end of the day, most people are left with the easier and more realistic solution of disposing of waste irresponsibly and throwing it in the garbage. In doing so, we all share in our collective consciousness this pain of knowing we’ve caused harm. That pain is real and some of us have shut down and just skipped thinking of recycling and do a quick throw in the garbage and move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, I think back of basketry or spoon making classes where we gather vine or fallen maple branches. The end result is not very far from its natural state and it\u0026rsquo;s therefore easy and satisfying to think of its end of life: just return it to the place it came from to resume its lifecycle. It many situations, this process wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be a conscious one: a basket might start rotting but still be useable. From the moment of its creation (or, arguable, the moment of harvest), it gradually decays until it reaches a breaking point and falls on the ground it came from. In the case of woody materials, it can serve as fuel for a fire where this can become a more conscious celebration of the cycles of life. In a way, the dreadful quest for figuring out a respectful way to dispose of something becomes a celebration of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4403/36290131834_d18e75bdf0_k_d.jpg\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back on what we know of human history, we can also make an interesting observation: the remnants we find of previous cultures are most of the time fairly recent. For the vast majority of it, we find proof of humans living without leaving traces behind. To me, this seems like hints and maybe even evidence that this period in human history was lived in a sustainable and harmonious way with the Earth where tools would gracefully degrade and feed in to the next cycle of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

      "content_html": "\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a few people near me talk about the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_method\"\u003eBates method\u003c/a\u003e to improve their vision. I remembered trying this when I was younger. At the time, my vision was deteriorating to a point where I couldn\u0026rsquo;t read the board from the back rows in class but I refused to wear glasses. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how seriously I tried this but I eventually gave up. Back then, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have had the behavioral tricks and experience to commit to an experiment and do it seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, triggered by those conversations about vision, I decided to do some more researching into the subject and eventually found out about \u003ca href=\"http://endmyopia.org\"\u003eendmyopia.org\u003c/a\u003e. The explanation of \u003ca href=\"http://endmyopia.org/end-myopia-home/\"\u003ehow myopia develops\u003c/a\u003e makes a lot of sense and there\u0026rsquo;s a certain rewilding elegance to the process of reverting it: since the eyes adapt to stimulus, reverting is a process of slowly giving them the opposite stimulus to adapt back to a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t vouch for the approach yet because I\u0026rsquo;ll be starting on the reduced long distance prescription in a few weeks and that\u0026rsquo;s what will provide that opposite stimulus. Until then, it\u0026rsquo;s just something that sounds promising. Still, the road to get to that reduced long distance prescription is compromised of several interesting habits that I think are worth talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main two habits will sound pretty simple and obvious but I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk about them for their side-benefits that I\u0026rsquo;ve come to greatly appreciate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention to your peripheral vision\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTake frequent breaks and go outside to do some distance vision\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"peripheral-vision\"\u003ePeripheral vision\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always been conscious that I had tunnel vision. I\u0026rsquo;ve had countless experiences of getting my head (thankfully my eyes are protected by glasses!) scratched by branches and not seeing things until they\u0026rsquo;re right in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was time to start the habit of \u0026ldquo;observing\u0026rdquo; in the peripheral vision, the first thing I noticed is how much everything around me was alive. Sometimes it would just be hints like shadows of crows flying above. But also butterflies, bees, crows, jays, squirrels, ants,  and, very importantly, leaves (and spiders, so many spiders!). Seeing leaves move (or not) with the wind got me to pay more attention to the weather too. Or maybe I should say paying more attention to the weather changes. Someone at \u003ca href=\"http://echoes-in-time.com\"\u003eEchoes in Time\u003c/a\u003e last summer said after several days of intense summer heat that he knew it would be cooler one day because the wind had changed the night before. I can\u0026rsquo;t say that I \u003cem\u003eget it\u003c/em\u003e now but it certainly makes a lot more sense to me and that would be much easier to do when you\u0026rsquo;re observing the wind in your peripheral vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not a huge breakthrough finding but it\u0026rsquo;s worth stating the obvious: peripheral vision is where you find awareness. If nothing else, you can observe things coming before they\u0026rsquo;re in focus and shift it accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4504/36776314274_0359e98d4e_k_d.jpg\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n        Painting inspired by the feeling of observing what\u0026#39;s not in focus\n        \n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"frequent-breaks-outside\"\u003eFrequent breaks outside\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea with this one is that by not doing close-up/computer work for more than 20 minutes and going outside for a while, you develop eye strain awareness and also minimize the ciliary muscle locking up that can happen from prolonged close-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started doing this, I was still actively working full-time on the computer. I was using \u003ca href=\"http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/\"\u003eawareness\u003c/a\u003e to tell me when I needed to step outside. At first, I would end up in the backyard and frustratingly trying to find something to look at in the distance. The more I did this, the more at peace I became with the fact that maybe I should adjust my expectations and just watch leaves or branches in the tall Elm tree. After a while, I started noticing crows hiding on the far end of the Elm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, I saw an unidentified mammal sleeping on a branch. At first, I could only see part of her back. But since I was coming back every 20 minutes, I eventually saw her from a different perspective as she had moved to another branch. A cute raccoon sleeping on a branch. I visited her every 20 minutes looking forward to the break instead of getting frustrated of having to interrupt whatever I was working on. Later, I took my camera with me and took a few pictures. She immediately woke up and I apologized for my rudeness. I had assumed that if the noise I was making was tolerable, the camera would be as well. But, apparently, the mechanical sound of the shutter was more disturbing than the sound of my voice of steps. We locked eyes for a minute and she eventually went back to sleep. I had made a mistake but I might have been forgiven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4507/23615190298_e857310d2c_o_d.jpg\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis experience with observing patiently at a distance and scanning the landscape brought me calm, awareness (again) and connectedness. It also taught me some patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few weeks later, you\u0026rsquo;d find me watching squirrels eat some acorns in the backyard. They seemed to be more used to close human contact and my little friends didn\u0026rsquo;t mind me taking some pictures. But to get close, I had to just remain there for long enough to be part of the picture they were observing. None of this is new. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about people having sit spot they regularly attend and that\u0026rsquo;s very similar to how I\u0026rsquo;ve approached this habit of taking breaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4505/37256916830_88342261b5_k_d.jpg\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExperimenting on fixing myopia might or might not bring me back clear vision. However, I think I can very confidently say this: the process to try to reverse it is bringing me back a sense of observation that I had been lost to me for incredibly long. This rich process is a subset of rewilding but it\u0026rsquo;s also a perfect analogy for how the bigger rewilding can enrich our lives with the unexpected benefits of living through that process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThings might be blurry in the transition but that bluriness can be beautiful too.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

      "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe Westfalia has been really useful lately in powering small appliances when we were under peak event power restrictions from Portland General Electric. In the morning, I’ve been putting it in neutral, unlocking the hand brake and pushing it slowly in the driveway to get the Van and its solar panel under the sun. It’s then pretty easy to just plug in the slow cooker or the dehydrator and use some of that “free” energy. Yes, I realize the irony of using all the technology to dehydrate food instead of directly using the sun but I figured that since we have it, it’s an acceptable compromise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4387/36875326410_35cd8af695_k_d.jpg\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I take the Van out this way more often, I get used to the inclination of the driveway and how hard and how long I need to push before I start holding it steady to put it in place. Every day, I do this faster because of my increased confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last few days, I found myself wanting to keep the momentum going and just pushing the Van until I get to the road. When I bring it to a stop by pushing it in the opposite direction, I find myself walking away and thinking of how nice it would be to just get on board, have the rest of the family join in and just drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it’s a ridiculous thought. We’d want to put some of our gear and camping essentials in the Van before going. But it’s not so much the litteral idea of leaving impulsively rather than just making that decision and then being free to go as we get ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, reflecting on those thoughts, I interpret this as a manifestation of my desire to break free from the many prisons within prisons that we’re stuck in. The relatively high rent that we’re paying meaning having to \u003cem\u003ework full-time\u003c/em\u003e. Even if we dropped the rent and adopted a semi-nomadic life for a little while, we’d still not be free (we need to have driver’s license, pay taxes, health and car insurance, etc.) but, depending on what would come next, what we’d learn and where we’d end up, we could be getting a few inches closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Her mother quickly hypothesized that he must have been looking at bone dust from working on a bone blade that I’d have neglected to clean up. I relectantly admitted this was a fair hypothesis since I had in fact neglected to clean up after myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few more minutes of talking and slowly accepting it was time to get up, my wife went outside while I checked the news.

This was an unusual scene and it felt a bit like an pre-apocalyptic moment. But since things remained somewhat functional, everyone was going with their default routine except with the addition of air filtering devices on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down, looking at the ash still falling and got thinking. Was this what the apocalypse would look like? A slow series of events we can accomodate to? I was reminded of how normative comparisons and seeing your neighbor’s behavior can affect one’s actions. In this case, the neighbors were going to work and sending their kids to school. It seemed like it wasn’t the time to stop and reconsider the best thing to do in that moment. This might indeed be something like an apocalypse but we’ve got enough layers of abstraction to not realize it and it’s making us blind to what’s almost at our doorsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"interlude\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eI imagine a parallel universe where enough neighbors would walk outside looking at the ash falling. Maybe a few of us would be crying thinking of the wildlife running away from the fire, losing their habitat. Maybe we’d start talking about how that’s also good for the forest to get a fire once in a while. Maybe we’d think of how the poor forest management and practices were making this one bigger and more devastating than it could have been. I imagine a few of us saying “fuck it, I’m not going to work today” and we’d just stay there, on the street, grieving together. Watching the red sun and the ashes falling silently, maybe we’d slowly start wanting to be closer to those events instead of just projecting pictures taken online in our minds. One of the neighbors would offer his place on the coast that needs some work to make sure the dead limbs aren’t a fire hazard.\u003c/p\u003e\n \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the mailwoman was back to normal (no bandana). The delivery guys were showing their unobstructed faces again. It’s true that the ashes weren’t falling from the sky like they did the day prior. But the smoke and red sun were still very present. In the background, we could hear the news about hurricanes down in the South. Major events for the news but nothing preventing us to go on with our routines. Was everyone already used to the new normal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4426/36401380603_98516091ab_h_d.jpg\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe temperature of the water just jumped a few degrees and the pace to a boil just increased but it seems like we might just get used to this.

I draw, I photograph, I write, I make the occasional basket or spoon, I go camping with my kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"interlude\"\u003e\n    \u003cem\u003eA few weeks ago, two squirrels were playing in the backyard trees, or maybe one was courting the other. They were running and jumping from branch to branch, from one tree to the other. Suddenly, one jumped and fell unexpectedly. The other one was obviously taken aback and stood still for a moment, seemingly wondering what to do and if his friend was well. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the fall was hurtful or not but it really seemed like those squirrels were having a natural good time.\u003c/em\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few years ago, I was made the tech lead of the team I was on. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it and said I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do it. My repulsion came from my allergy to meetings but I also didn’t like the idea of being distracted from what I do best to include tasks that I didn’t think I was terribly good at. In the spirit of making this liveable for me given my feelings of apprehension, I was spared some of the most boring aspects of the job. I still didn’t feel comfortable with the situation. After some time and a pretty dramatic series of events and discussions, I finally got out of being assigned the title of tech lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next 2 years, things were better. I had enough reputation to be given the autonomy to decide what I should be working on. I knew what needed to be done and how to do it so I just did. It felt pretty good. However, I still had to deal with discussions about the future of my career or what I should do to get to my next promotion. Every time, I made it clear that I didn’t care about getting promoted. In fact, I requested to \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e be considered for a promotion. In doing so, I really wanted to avoid changes in how people saw me and my responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, I recently got asked what’s the next thing I wanted to work on. The motivation wasn’t a bad one. Managers want to help their employees remain satisfied and interested in their work. Talking about their future is one way they think they can achieve that. However, for reasons I won’t get into, I didn’t really want to discuss “big initiatives” and my “future at the company”. Really, I just wanted to live day to day and continue picking up the next piece of work that I thought I could help with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhich led me to this request to opt-out of being managed. After trying to just dodge the big questions, I eventually gave up on trying and just asked to skip regularly scheduled one on one manager/employee meetings. I requested specifically to be allowed to do what I’m best at and not be stressed out or pressured to think about bigger career evolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-this-means\"\u003eWhat this Means\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor several years, I had been fighting with everything that represented formal rules/hierarchy/management and was naturally doing work, collaborating with peers and having a good time when feeling free to do so. I still often felt trapped by some processes and even more by the context of my employment but I still had the mild good fortune of being tolerated in this  self-attributed freedom to self-organize. And only after I formulated this request to “opt-out of being managed” did I realize that what I was really longing for was \u003cstrong\u003eanarchy\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, anarchy is simply that freedom to self-organize. You might be a lone anarchist but, as I\u0026rsquo;ve described previously, it works really well when collaborating with peers/friends/family/community or even random strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the reasons I didn’t like the label “Software Engineer” is that it seems to be a discipline encompassing many different facets of building software (architecture, design, mentoring, etc). For me, “software engineering” feels like we’re trying to pack-in a career progression and, as a result, a hierarchy. You can only be in charge of \u0026ldquo;architecture\u0026rdquo; if you\u0026rsquo;ve done a few years of being a Senior Software Engineer. While coding involves the same things (design, architecture, teaching peers), it also sounds more action-driven and \u003cem\u003eholistic\u003c/em\u003e. To code something, you have to do those other things as well. However, all of it would be done naturally without as much formality around it. In fact, it might often feel \u003cem\u003eso natural\u003c/em\u003e that is just seems like one big flow of necessary actions. Granted, my interpretation of the words is very subjective but I think that I might not be alone in this interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the definitions of the labels I just mentionned are very subjective and informed by personal experience (rather than literal definitions), I realized at some point that my understanding of \u003cem\u003ecoder\u003c/em\u003e (or my definition of it) goes hand in hand with anarchism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"anarchy-and-software\"\u003eAnarchy and Software\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly enough, my friend \u003ca href=\"http://www.petermichaelbauer.com\"\u003ePeter Michael Bauer\u003c/a\u003e used coders as an example of natural anarchists during one of his \u003ca href=\"http://www.rewildportland.com/rewilding-201/\"\u003eRewilding 201\u003c/a\u003e classes: promoting freedom of information, open-source projects with decentralized control, collaboration with peers with no ultimate ownership. At the time, I thought that this was true on some level but I downplayed this based on my experience in the software industry which doesn\u0026rsquo;t, like all industries,  follow the same ideology. Some companies like \u003ca href=\"https://github.com\"\u003egithub\u003c/a\u003e have tried to do this with some success but not always with a lot of intention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes me think that, if given the chance, anarchism could work really well. Accidental anarchism success stories (like \u003ca href=\"https://github.com\"\u003egithub\u003c/a\u003e seem to exist because groups of people naturally worked this way, it gave great results and it was enjoyable. Of course, pressures from the capitalist market and desire for growth (rather than quality or sustainability) might have resulted in this system falling appart after some time or when reaching a size too big for self-organization. However, it seems telling that this is how a lot of people enjoy and get excited about working this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"labeling-caveats\"\u003eLabeling Caveats\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not a fan of using labels. It creates a division that is often a blocker to empathy. However, I think it can be useful in expressing a set of ideas more quickly to move the conversation to the next level. I also realize that labels can oversimplify those ideas and even erode some of their original meaning which then becomes a recipe for misunderstandings. Additionally, appropriating the label “arnarchist” to describe myself in the context of a capitalist tech industry might be a disservice to real anarchists trying to push real change and I\u0026rsquo;d like to limit my use only to open up a discussion about general anarchy amongst peers who feel like they naturally tend towards this way of working or living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"broader-picture\"\u003eBroader Picture\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou might be one of those coders. You might have just realized that you might be an anarchist in the context of how you work. If so, you should consider what this means in other facets of life. It’s easy to compartmentalize and go back to your routine accepting the rules and hierarchy built-in all that surrounds us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe stop and ask yourself what this could mean if you were to imagine a different world. Maybe a world where the civilized \u0026ldquo;normality\u0026rdquo; is gone and we\u0026rsquo;re free to live in collaboration with our friends and neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"interlude\"\u003e\n    \u003cem\u003eVireo comes back with a roadkill deer. After making initial cuts to separate the legs, others join in to process the meat, bones, hide, organs. Some of it is set up to dry as jerky while the organs are shared amongst the group and eaten on the spot. Some do cooking while some work on using all of the animal for tools. No one is directing the whole operation. Some is done in silence while some is met with chatter on what would be the most useful option in this situation, for this group of people, at this very moment.\u003c/em\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’d like to continue exploring further down that path, you might enjoy reading this somewhat dense but interesting \u003ca href=\"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/moxie-marlinspike-and-windy-hart-audio-anarchy-radio-an-anarchist-critique-of-democracy\"\u003eAnarchist Critique of Democracy\u003c/a\u003e.

As we were migrating from one place to the other, we often felt lost with unfamiliar people and places.  But at the same time, we were learning about ourselves and clarifying what we\u0026rsquo;d desire from a environment and what we\u0026rsquo;d like to contribute back. After reading \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-War-Invasive-Species-Permaculture/dp/160358563X\"\u003eBeyond the War on Invasive Species\u003c/a\u003e, I now have a feeling that this migration process was more \u003cem\u003enatural\u003c/em\u003e that we thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou see, the more time passes, the less any previous “home” qualifies as a native place for myself and my family. To this day, I can still say that I spent most of my life in Québec. And the place I’ve stayed the longest at is a small village Eastern of the province. But, looking back on the various stages of my life, it would be difficult to pretend that this small village is my native place. In some ways, it \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e have been since some of the key elements I’m looking for \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e were found in that place (and might still be) but the circumstances weren’t right and I was not right for that place at the time. I had to find another environment in which to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, since then, I’ve migrated and, one could say, became an invader. In some of those places I’ve migrated to, I changed. In a few of those, I think I might also have brought some change around me (maybe). And, as I look back on those patterns, I see parallels with my experience and invasive species in constantly changing ecosystems. I\u0026rsquo;m just another creature trying to find a good place that works for me and maybe bring something positive back to that place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I do a less than great job at contributing back to the places I visit than most \u0026ldquo;invasive\u0026rdquo; plants but I find comfort in knowing that I’m not necessarily forever lost for finding myself in a new and non-native place. The quest for a home is not stopping but it could become more interesting. Thinking of other living beings that become welcome additions to local ecosystems (at least by livings not fighting the war on invasives), I could now imagine myself having a similar role in a place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it might very well be that this place doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be one of my previous addresses for me to feel like I belong there.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

If we already suffered an isolated life before the move, it wasn’t worse than most priviledged modern families. Of course that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean much as our modern world pushes us further and further away from each other. Still, we had friends, family and we even talked to some of our neighbors (!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe lost some of that when we landed in California. As time passed, we did get to know some people: mostly me through work and Flavie through school. After 3 years, we moved to Portland because of my SF tech overdose, the ridiculousness of it all (alluding to the rent prices and the water shortage would barely scratch the surface) but also because there seemed to be a focus in Portland on things that that started coming in focus for ourselves: unschooling, rewilding, nature and health. But with remote work and unschooling, we again hit a bump on the isolation road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings me to what I really wanted to say: the more we move closer to our uncommon convictions, the more we might feel isolated. In other words, the more we move away from a system that we can’t support anymore, the harder it seems to become to stay connected with people that still fully support it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that, I think, is one significant barriers to rewilding for some. Or so it appears initially. While it’s easy to continue having casual conversations with colleagues and friends who don’t currently share the same views, it feels like a lie by ommission to avoid talking about rewilding. Because, truthfully, everything can be connected to the desire for civilization to collapse, for our place to be restored in nature, for our regenerative work to begin. But there are some people that would turn off completely if exposed to these ideas prematurely. And skipping on those discussions seems to me like just another form of isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe it doesn’t have to be that way. Maybe it’s just a matter of choosing the right words. Most people, deep down, aren’t happy with their life and that opens up a discussion about \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e better. For a relative newcomer to the ideas of rewilding like me, it might even be easier to relate to people who are uninitiated rather than the teachers who are so further ahead. It might not be as satisfactory as getting to the core of \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e we should tackle everything that needs to be done but it seems like an important part. With the benefit that there’s a potential for reaching out to more people and even strenghtening relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll said, I believe the reality might be an unelegant mix. I can’t help but feel the need to break away from this isolation bubble by interacting with like-minded folks. It seems \u003cem\u003esomewhat\u003c/em\u003e realistic that some some form of rewilding discussions can happen with friends who are not currently thinking of rewilding or just not thinking of rewilding in the same terms and definitions. It seems unrealistic that this can be fully satisfactory. I’ve said it before but it seems as relevant today than when I wrote this \u003ca href=\"/new-light-on-that-blue\"\u003elong ago\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI’m not sure friends are forever but we forever needs friends.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, ideally, some of those friends would be passionate rewilders because it’s a topic that we can’t really pause from thinking about for very long.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

However, after some more researching, it appears that, while there were extinctions before civilization, those were not quite at the same level nor within the same context. I already had some intuition to that effect and I felt relief to find some of that evidence presented in \u003ca href=\"https://leanpub.com/rewildandlive\"\u003eRewild 101\u003c/a\u003e. Civilization would have amplified our destructive impact by orders of magnitude. However, I now think that extinctions prior to civilization were closer to events that would occur naturally as part of evolution and cohabitation between other species. We can \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e bad about those but they should reveal themselves as neither good or bad. In contract with current extinctions, those represent something closer to a natural outcome to a particular set of circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this new perspective doesn’t really change the idea that we should rewild and reconnect with nature, it does offer us an interesting proposition: we could have a positive place amongst other livings. That process might involve a lot of hardships and it won’t happen quickly but the idea that it could brings me joy here and now.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

All thoughts and ideas expressed here are subject to change at any moment.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdeas evolve and change. Or, at least, they usually do. When I picked up \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Sixth-Extinction-Unnatural-History/dp/0805092994\"\u003eThe Sixth Extinction\u003c/a\u003e, I had a sense that I might not get much new to advance my current ideas. I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy skepticism seem warranted when, reading the introduction, it appeared as if the book was about the telling of a great story first and foremost. But while that might have been the author’s  initial motivation, she made a convincing case that even if she might have been looking for a story, it might just happen to be one that is incredibly captivating because of its importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sixth Extinction, also named the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction\"\u003eholocene extinction\u003c/a\u003e, is the one we\u0026rsquo;re currently experiencing. There are many intuitive ways we can imagine ourselves playing a role in extinctions that globally make this one up: climate change, GMOs, surpopulation, overfishing. All of which are fairly recent on a geologic time scale. Going back just a little bit further, we could think that agriculture, civilization and colonization could have been immensely destructive. That would also be very right. It was and it remains more so than anything else. As we go back further though, it gets increasingly interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was a \u003cem\u003elittle\u003c/em\u003e surprised to find more evidence that our hunter gatherers ancestors might also have been causing mass extinctions. What follows is based on very incomplete research is incomplete and only partial data. Also consider that we got facts about history wrong many times before. So, with the data that we currently have, it would seem like extinctions started with the homo sapiens. Before homo sapiens, neanderthals seemed to be doing well on Earth. It remains to be explored what was so different between neanderthals and homo sapiens but it would seem that ingenuity, creativity and ambition were qualities that could have had a major factor in newly occurring destruction. Or maybe it was our ability to tell ourselves stories, deal with virtual/abstract things (i.e. money, religion) and collaborate together based on those stories. Or maybe it was a deep and constant appetite for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eColonizing remote continents is one obvious way homo sapiens have impacted ecosystems and caused harm. But it\u0026rsquo;s also very obvious how the same traits are still causing us to destroy faster and more decisively by the day. The same homo sapiens quality that is making me want to write about this idea is contributing to us to destroy our environment. This was a deep revelation for me, as a self-qualified \u0026ldquo;creative\u0026rdquo; person. What the planet would need, it seems, is boring and predictable species. Ones that are content living in equilibrium in their habitat. But this is fundamentally not how homo sapiens are. And very disappointingly, native tribes are not immune to this. It follows that rewilding ourselves might not be the saving grace. It \u003cem\u003ewould\u003c/em\u003e be going in the right direction: using less resources and being more connected to nature can only be good. It would most definitely be a better life for most of us urban folks. But I doubt it would be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI realize that this is a hard conclusion to come to and it might appear awfully negative. I guess it is. But only if we view it purely in the lens that \u003cem\u003elife\u003c/em\u003e means \u003cem\u003ehuman life\u003c/em\u003e. If we try to view human life as just another form of life, there’s optimism. Because, with the bringing of the Sixth Extinction, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that one of the species going extinct is going to be the homo sapiens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow is that optimistic? Well, let’s talk about the common “optimistic” scenario for a constrast. One common suggested alternative is that the human \u0026ldquo;ingenuity\u0026rdquo; gives us a solution. Imagine technological means to explore and settle on a new planet. Throw the Earth away and take our \u003cem\u003estuff\u003c/em\u003e to a new world. This, to me, is \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e pessimistic scenario. After destroying all life on Earth, we\u0026rsquo;d get to do it all over on another world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo now what? I\u0026rsquo;m going to bet that we don\u0026rsquo;t survive the Sixth Extinction. I\u0026rsquo;m going to bet that several resilient or lucky species do. I\u0026rsquo;m going to bet that with enough time, evolution will take its course and new species with pop up. The Earth will find a new balance again. Life will strive and the Earth will be a nice home again. Maybe a new species of bipeds like the Neanderthals will appear. A smart biped ape that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be inflicted by the urge to realize bigger dreams than just living in symbiosis with its environment. That, to me, is the optimistic scenario. That\u0026rsquo;s the one I\u0026rsquo;m betting on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI realize that betting against my own species could be considered trahison. But if we just think of ourselves as one member of a larger group that is \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo;, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem as terrible of an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, how this affects how I live now gets a bit more complicated. We all want to live. \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e still want to live. I\u0026rsquo;d like to move in the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; direction but it becomes very confusing as to what this could be. Another way to look at it would be that as we\u0026rsquo;re going extinct, I should just find a quiet space to reflect in the meantime. A life closer to nature. Try to find solace knowing that when we won\u0026rsquo;t be there, some of this nature and some of this life will actually be able to strive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo maybe that\u0026rsquo;s it. It might be time to come to peace with the resolution that we screwed up. Come to terms with the idea that \u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e are the problem. Saying our final good byes before we go the way of the dodo. And know, that maybe, probably, there will still be life after us and that life will be smart enough to not try and get too smart to disturb a fragile and beautiful equilibrium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut, of course, this might also be a bump in the road to a brighter, continuously evolving set of thoughts and ideas where we’d be a force for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eUpdate: Back to \u003ca href=\"/positive-optimism\"\u003epositive optimism\u003c/a\u003e with new information after digging into pre-history.

The author goes into the history of humanity and its “ingenuity”. She goes on to tell the story of “pivots” in history. Along the way, tragedies happen (indigenous people are exterminated, species disappear and sustainable ways of life are destroyed) but they’re always brushed off very quickly as minor downsides of something that brought a net positive. Each time, she tells us that out of the problems that we introduced, we found solutions that made us better than when we started. And, in every case, I found myself offended that she would say that. In every case, I was thinking to myself that we had just taken a wrong turn that should have prompted us to turn back. Instead, we celebrated an illusion of progress that was bringing us deeper into a path of destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMultiple times, she goes on to say that we were better because more people had food, we could expand and considering going back would be impossible because of all the life that needed to be sustained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut which life? The fact is that she equals “life” with \u003cem\u003ehuman\u003c/em\u003e life. More precisely, the modern civilized human. What about all the life that we, empire people, ended up killing the process? What about the species that go extinct every day? She shows a profound denial of what life truly is. Life is everywhere and it relies on the balance we so obviously disturbed and now try to control. Would going back to hunting and gathering mean widespread famine? Likely. But would this be a net loss for life? I’m not so sure. All signs point to a potential for better balance. In the process, it would bring a long lost humility to our species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt would also probably mean that I’d be one of the casualties given my dependence on modern drugs for my disease of modern life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard to say what I would decide for humanity if I was asked to. Would I go for the continuity, hoping we’d find remedies to all of the ill we’re inflicting on our world and ourselves? Or would I go for turning back, knowing this would bring the demise of myself and countless others who exist or continue to exist with dependence on modernity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounds like an easy decision. There’s hope that human ingenuity might bring us to unimaginable territories and there’s  no chance I could live without the modern civilization as a type 1 diabetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am, in theory, in favour for turning back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think that the days, week or month of that life that I’d get back living connected to other life might be worth it.

That’s when I radically changed my lifestyle to try and fix my degrading type 1 diabetic health. I had already learned about the effectiveness of simple behavioural science principles to power my commitment to make change happen.  I felt the benefits very quickly. In less than 6 months, I had started the reversal of early signs of retinopathy. But I had also learned that things weren’t so simple in nutrition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarch 2013 was when I learned that I had trusted the wrong sources about nutrition and health more generally. What else did I assumed as universal truth but wasn’t? 18 months later, I’m still wondering what’s the best diet for me. I learned that there isn’t one solution that fits everyone. I’ve also learned about several things that affect health but, more importantly, I learned that it’s only a tiny fraction of what there is to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, I also learned about rewilding. I then learned that rewilding means different things to different people. I learned some of its definitions. I learned about new ideas on waste, consumption and the economy religion. I learned about tiny housing and a minimalistic way of life. None of it is simple. There are some very compelling perspective on the modern life but there’s also no clear and unique solution and path forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I’m sitting here bombarded with very assertive statements and solutions to achieve health, accomplishment, happiness and financial freedom.

The project juxtaposes drawings of \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes\"\u003eCalvin and Hobbes\u003c/a\u003e with fitting nature photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy themselves, the photos would be pretty good albeit lacking a distinguishing element. With Calvin and Hobbes, the scene comes alive. The drawings bring a touch of imagination in an otherwise very real scene. I felt as if the world was being filled with mystical creatures from storybooks. It\u0026rsquo;s breaking the monotony of a thousand pretty pictures while celebrating of the beauty of nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can tell I felt inspired by that work. I also happen to take random unpublished pictures suited for such compositing work: \u003cem\u003ewallpaper-nice\u003c/em\u003e caliber but nothing crazy unique. I also happen to draw things. Or, I try to. Here is my first attempt at this type of composite art. It\u0026rsquo;s an old pouring rain picture that I augmented with my drawing of a snail. I have much better photos in reserve for this type of work but this one seemed to be fitting with my character so I\u0026rsquo;m going with that. Uncharacteristically for me, this won\u0026rsquo;t be a scheduled project.

Just because I feel like blogging today. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s just how it\u0026rsquo;s going to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe past week was really great. Don\u0026rsquo;t you care to know why? Well, fine, I\u0026rsquo;m telling anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt starts with me just trying to get some data on the distribution of the data across regions in hbase.

The visuals are really good and it definitely increases our ability to quickly see where we\u0026rsquo;re at compared to a text output (which can also be done pretty easily with an hbase shell script).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith this running instance on our data quickly came the realization that we\u0026rsquo;d use this for real. And, like, \u003cem\u003eright now\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn closer look, I noticed issues with getting compaction logs.

The \u003cstrong\u003eprocess\u003c/strong\u003e is really the topic I had in mind when sitting down to write this. Or rather the lack thereof really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDid you notice? I just lied straight to your face and I knew you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t budge. Actually, there _is_ a process but Github makes it all so easy and fun that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like the drag we so often associate with processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s how this lays out: You read about this thing or google your way to it.

You might need to sell people of that feature you think _should definitely_ be in the scope of the project. You know, it\u0026rsquo;s complicated™. But Github helps.

Even for a one line change. I\u0026rsquo;d like to show the whole world about this thing I just did. Please refrain though. People will run away screaming if you do this too often.

But the entry barrier is just a little bit higher. It takes more time. Some of that precious and limited energy that you have is spent on the _other_ stuff that, well, isn\u0026rsquo;t as much fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnything to make the process so easy it just seems to \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e exist is an amazing feat. \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e really enables tons of changes (okay, I just made that up but I really think it\u0026rsquo;s a good uneducated guess) by just making a path available from discovering a personal need to getting it done.

Surrender a fee and it\u0026rsquo;s yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis sounds like a ransom note from a villain. It\u0026rsquo;s not. This is the promise of music services like \u003ca href=\"http://rdio.com/\"\u003eRdio\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0026rsquo;s great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remember feeling hesitant when the digital age began. I liked putting my favourite albums on display. After some time, I realized that I never actually looked at them and it was just more _stuff_ to carry around. I slowly stopped buying physical CDs. This was liberating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen came the iTunes age. I would buy albums and store them in a nice folder that kept growing. Backed up with \u003ca href=\"http://www.backblaze.com/\"\u003eBackblaze\u003c/a\u003e too. However, I now look at some of this music and I\u0026rsquo;ve either listened it to death or I\u0026rsquo;ve changed my mind about it. In all cases, most of the time, I just listen to the more recent great stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat last part has been a problem for me in the last few years. You know how it is. When you become a dad, you\u0026rsquo;ve got less free time. I know some dads that are still up-to-date on the latest great music but I think you\u0026rsquo;ve got only a few picks to make when you\u0026rsquo;ve got less free time. I chose photography and software. I had to give up on music. Thankfully, some of the bands I was listening to are still doing some innovative work so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t  _completely _out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I moved this year, I also decided to try to get back into it a bit more. Ideally without having to put too much time into it. My priorities hadn\u0026rsquo;t changed. I tried \u003ca href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\"\u003ePandora\u003c/a\u003e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have such a good experience with \u003ca href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e. Even though I had access to a huge selection, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to look for. \u003ca href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\"\u003ePandora\u003c/a\u003e was definitely better in that regard. I could use something I knew as a reference and get a radio station with potentially good picks. That was unsatisfying to me though. When you stumble on a great track and want to listen to more of that band, you\u0026rsquo;re left on your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnter \u003ca href=\"http://rdio.com/\"\u003eRdio\u003c/a\u003e. After reading good words about it, I decided give the trial a try. I liked it. I still do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, I had access to playlists that were a great starting point (like pitchfork\u0026rsquo;s best songs). Then, as I discovered things I liked, I could add bands and albums to my collection and even synchronize them to my iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEasy discovery with trusted curated content and access to an exhaustive music library. Sure, I have to pay every month. But, one month of \u003ca href=\"http://rdio.com/\"\u003eRdio\u003c/a\u003e is the price of a single album on iTunes. Yes, I lose it all if I decide to cancel. When you think about it though, that music I was listening to a few months ago isn\u0026rsquo;t really what I\u0026rsquo;m going to want to listen to in two months anyway. Also, if I were to find another solution, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have the same music there anyway. And if not, that\u0026rsquo;s fine too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe really cool thing about all of this though goes beyond easy access to music: No more \u003cem\u003estuff\u003c/em\u003e. Nothing to carry around. This is definitely more liberating that the jump to the digital age. This is acknowledging that we change and we might not have to keep all of our things from the past with us because we cherished it at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI still have stuff I\u0026rsquo;m carrying along with me, way _too_ much. I know. Hopefully though, this stuff is now more of my own creations (or my creation tools) than stuff I acquire. Not ideal, but better.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Well, at least, what I haven\u0026#39;t forgotten.\n        \n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eUpdate: the initial version was way too purple on print. It did look fine on my iPhone screen but the print was definitely not blue, especially when under indoor lights. The guys at gelaskin were kind enough to give me another one for free that I could do with an updated version of the image. This is what you\u0026rsquo;re seeing here. I changed the blue to something that I felt was a safer bet (and better looking to). They looked at it before shipping and they did confirm it looked blue\u0026hellip;for real this time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a well-known fact that lack of sunlight affects mood. I know this to be true but it\u0026rsquo;s easy to tell ourselves we\u0026rsquo;re just too strong to feel the influence of something so out of our control as this distant sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that the sun does help. But the sun is shy in San Francisco during what we conventionally call \u0026ldquo;summer\u0026rdquo;. Most of the time, the fog is king. Obviously, the closer you get to the coast, the worse it is (or the better it is if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for atmospheric fog).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen, there\u0026rsquo;s September. People say the fog magically leaves by September. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s a big lie. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some of the thickest fog this September and we barely had any sun. I can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure if it\u0026rsquo;s an anomaly but if someone tells you September is never foggy here, it\u0026rsquo;s a blatant lie. This year was the proof (oh, isn\u0026rsquo;t fun to prove a proposition by a single contradiction?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen came October. And now, oh boy, did October deliver. It was great. Not _too _hot but \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e right (except for that one time where it was \u003cem\u003eway\u003c/em\u003e too hot but that lasted like just one second). Along with the first days of October came the sun and it felt great. You might be like me and love seeing nature\u0026rsquo;s force in action (snowstorms, pouring rain, thunder, thick fog) but we need the sun. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think so much before but I do now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen, I remember Montreal. I know, it\u0026rsquo;s been only 6 months or so since we left. You know how it is though. As you leave a place, you start feeling the ties more strongly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this manifested in an odd manner. I felt like I should show my identity (as if people can\u0026rsquo;t tell from the way I talk). That\u0026rsquo;s a tricky thing. I\u0026rsquo;m not one to just dress myself with a flag or hang it by the window. But then, there had been this thing I had seen and liked for its looks but didn\u0026rsquo;t really feel right: a \u003ca href=\"http://www.gelaskins.com/store/phones/iPhone_4/O_Canada\"\u003eCanadian flag skin\u003c/a\u003e for the iPhone. There was also the \u003ca href=\"http://www.gelaskins.com/store/phones/iPhone_4/Stars_and_Stripes\"\u003eUnited States flag\u003c/a\u003e, not right either. \u003ca href=\"http://www.gelaskins.com/store/phones/iPhone_4/Union_Jack\"\u003eUK flag\u003c/a\u003e? Even worse. You can guess the rest of the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOh, you can\u0026rsquo;t? Well, I made my own gelaskin. My Quebec flag gelaskin. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I would actually use it if I were still living in Quebec but here? I like the idea. I know I\u0026rsquo;ve said in the past that cases and screen protectors are \u003cstrong\u003ebad\u003c/strong\u003e but I\u0026rsquo;m making a compromise here. A gelaskin isn\u0026rsquo;t actually a case: it should not add much perceptible thickness to my phone and it\u0026rsquo;s not covering any of the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike it? Feel free to use \u003ca href=\"http://heyitsalex.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JeMeSouviensVersion2.jpg\"\u003eit\u003c/a\u003e to make your own.

Talking specifically about weather (yep, this has been my great weather post!), we won\u0026rsquo;t get the great snowstorms of Montreal\u0026rsquo;s winter. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s always the same though. It might seem like it is sometimes. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday: same forecast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen one day, it\u0026rsquo;s different. One day, there\u0026rsquo;s that pouring rain threatening a Giants game or that thicker fog that completely erases the view. And sometimes, there\u0026rsquo;s the sun and it\u0026rsquo;s rays shinning on through the leaves, bouncing off windows to come and tickle our senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Then, see how it feels.\nDo not worry, I\u0026rsquo;m not planning on making regular posts about my feelings, probably.*\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo here it is, my take on this prompt:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat a character holding a blue object is thinking about?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere I was, holding a blue pen. I had just lost my train of thought. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly looking at it so much as this was an out of focus blue spot. Not any blue either. It was a blue recalling Québec\u0026rsquo;s national blue. I always felt pretty neutral with that particular hue. I always loved blue but I disliked this particular one, much to my chagrin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday though, this blue is reminiscent of what we\u0026rsquo;ve left behind. We always knew it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be easy to relocate. The nice things about California are indeed \u003cem\u003enice\u003c/em\u003e but it\u0026rsquo;s not so much like we weren\u0026rsquo;t happy with Montréal. This story isn\u0026rsquo;t one of a quest for the promised land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/14092047/m%3D900/374628c29b6de4a859eb8bcdb6dbf069\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n        There\u0026#39;s that theme of being somewhere else, shot by me in the Golden Gate Park woods.\n        \n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome days, we read about cool things that are happening right here, only here. Those days, I feel very fortunate to be here. Other days, we read about some interesting change happening in Montréal and we feel like we\u0026rsquo;re missing out. This is a very typical case of nostalgia versus novelty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of that is relatively minor though, in the grand scheme of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEverything, except one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI can do with a slower public transit system.\nI can deal with a more complex health care system.\nI can accept living in a less lively neighbourhood.\nI am however having a real hard time not having friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat friends I hear you thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s true that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have many. I had to make sacrifices when it became obvious that, as a parent, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to do all I was doing before. Friendship took second place to personal projects and family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that this is oversimplifying. I still had friends. I was seeing some of them almost exclusively at the office but they \u003cem\u003ewere\u003c/em\u003e my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be easy to make new friends. I was anticipating that the English speaking version of me would be struggling to find the words to express nuanced thoughts. It would be more difficult to be \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it would be a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs it harder than I thought it would be? Maybe not. But having anticipated it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it any easier to deal with, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also very much neglected the difficulty in coordinating talking with friends in Eastern time. We\u0026rsquo;re living in an always connected world after all, aren’t we? It could be easier if I didn\u0026rsquo;t care so much about my work but I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s what I came here for and I do love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s no happy revelation here. No words of wisdom. I didn\u0026rsquo;t make a new friend just today that made everything all better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of those things that will incrementally get better over time. I suppose. I hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure friends are forever but you could say that we forever needs friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, I see this blue pen today and it appears in this newly rediscovered grandiose hue.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Doesn\u0026#39;t it serve as a good illustration for the slow passage of time?\n        \n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s an interesting question and not and an easy one to find answers to. It turns out that in our human world, not much can happen in a second. That may be counterintuitive for some. It just sounds right to our ears to hear that some big thing happened in a split second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s dramatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat accident occurred in a split second.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom one second to the next, everything went from great to chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s interesting about those examples is that they really are not things that happened in a second. If you stop and think about it, in most cases, an accident had been in gestation for several seconds, minutes, hours, days. Sensationalism and big drama makes us report it otherwise. That, however, can be a rant for some other day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet me share this personal story. A story you might know about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was this moment last year when my life took a turn. I had received an invitation for a job recruitment event in Montreal for a position on the United States West Coast. I was not really considering relocating but my wife said: \u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003eWhy not?\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rdquo;. Indeed, why not? At that moment, I started steering towards that new path. The horizon opened. You could argue that this change occurred at that second. I disagree. I think I had been contemplating the idea for some time. This idea was far-fetched, unrealistic. But that moment when that question triggered important and new answers was important not in itself, but as a tipping point in a series of events, experiences, reflections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I say that not much happens in a second, that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m referring to. There\u0026rsquo;s that decisive moment that breaks the \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eafter\u003c/em\u003e and we\u0026rsquo;re tempted to think it all happened \u003cem\u003eright then\u003c/em\u003e but I believe the reality is different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure we pass by such moments everyday because we\u0026rsquo;re not in the right mindset (which is quite alright too). As much as big drama seems to feed on split seconds twists, it\u0026rsquo;s often all the little moments that make a big one possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what can happen in one second? Millions of computations? Several frames in a video? Thousands of tweets? Yes, yes, yes and yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut when we’re talking about stories, there’s always more hidden behind that instant of drama.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

We all have different tastes and opinions. As such, you might disagree but let\u0026rsquo;s just stop for a minute to look at pictures we like (I\u0026rsquo;ll go do something better while you take a few moments and do it). I think you\u0026rsquo;ll find that those are recurring patterns: shallow depth of field, uncoloured backgrounds, isolated subject, sharp focus. All of them have the same effect: make _one_ single thing stand out. Even ultra wide angles that seem to capture all of the surroundings produce great images when their focus is on making one thing stand out: the perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTourist photos are sickening because they do all the opposite.

A kid holding a coloured umbrella walking out of the fog on the golden gate bridge would be magnificent (I should do that shot before I start to think of the potential challenges involved). Let\u0026rsquo;s just forget about taking pictures of you and ALL of that gigantic scene. Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on isolated things. If you must take a picture with the statue of a president, make it a close up of yourself French kissing it. Want to capture yourself with the beautiful Apple store? Take a close shot of a reflection in it\u0026rsquo;s recognizable glass walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour job as the photographer (I know, it\u0026rsquo;s not your job, it\u0026rsquo;s just a hobby) is showing one interesting thing and removing everything else that gets in the way. Or at least, it\u0026rsquo;s a big part of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell enough talk, now let\u0026rsquo;s try this. Don\u0026rsquo;t wait to be on vacation. Next time you\u0026rsquo;re outside, go play tourist in your own hometown. That\u0026rsquo;s something we always neglect anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe keep a \u003cem\u003efew\u003c/em\u003e happy snapshots along the way as a peace offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJust in case.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Of course, if you\u0026rsquo;re just a slacker constantly putting off tasks, that won\u0026rsquo;t help. You might get some things done once in a while but your chain will look like a bunch of stupid rings.

      "content_html": "\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou dear reader should already know that I\u0026rsquo;m a new San Franciscan and ex-Montréaler. As such, I present you with great authority the definite guide to San Francisco for Montréalers. It\u0026rsquo;s really more of a collection of fairly obvious differences between Montréal and San Francisco. I really rely on my blog getting zero readership to shield me from real potential of offending residents of both cities. It may have been better titled as \u0026ldquo;10 differences between Montréal and San Francisco\u0026rdquo; but I hate those. They most often come in round numbers which I find suspicious. How convenient would it be if there were really 10 differences between the two cities?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering this, I\u0026rsquo;m not even counting how many I\u0026rsquo;m listing here. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that to you and I might just trick you and update this list (hey, this could be a living document). The following represent my opinions but I believe it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say most with the same background as me would agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"stm-kicks-ass-and-muni-not-so-much\"\u003eSTM Kicks Ass and Muni not so Much\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0026rsquo;t know what you have until you lose it, right? Actually, I knew the \u003ca href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/stm-wins-the-stanley-cup-of-public-transport-for-north-america\"\u003eSTM was pretty good\u003c/a\u003e. But after seeing tramways, BART and buses in movies depicting San Francisco, I thought the public transport here would be amazing. It\u0026rsquo;s not really. Muni is cheaper but it\u0026rsquo;s also as slow as it is unreliable. To be fair, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely a problem of Muni but rather a problem with traffic and lack of speedy ways reserved for buses. Express buses are not really \u003cem\u003eexpress\u003c/em\u003e. Additionally if you have a positively surprising experience with an express bus one day, Muni will make sure to make it up the next day with the express just flying by your stop with a bus fully packed of people. Yes, leaving you, the hopeful commuter, standing there feeling the chilly wind crushing your hopes of a quick transit and the seed of cynicism growing inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, there are also little details like no sign whatsoever for Express buses stops on Pine street. There are several express routes stopping here and you don\u0026rsquo;t have any way of telling which will stop where. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s knowledge that gets passed from \u003cem\u003egeneration to generation\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve been told it\u0026rsquo;s in somewhat numerical ordering by some wise guy who seemed to have reversed engineered it. Still haven\u0026rsquo;t verified it. I just memorized the address of the building where the 31AX stops (for the record, it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=360+pine+st,+San+francisco\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;ll=37.791558,-122.401353\u0026amp;spn=0.006249,0.013937\u0026amp;sll=37.792069,-122.402002\u0026amp;layer=c\u0026amp;cbp=13,16.36,,0,0.05\u0026amp;cbll=37.791962,-122.40204\u0026amp;gl=us\u0026amp;hnear=360+Pine+St,+San+Francisco,+California+94104\u0026amp;t=m\u0026amp;z=17\u0026amp;iwloc=A\u0026amp;panoid=7CHnHdxivs7YOWxItuJU8Q\"\u003e360 Pine St\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-sf-bus-drivers-all-hate-life-montréal-drivers-actually-enjoy-driving-people\"\u003eThe SF Bus Drivers All Hate Life, Montréal Drivers Actually Enjoy Driving People\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s true. You may want to be polite or friendly and salute your driver when you enter or thank him/her when you get off but you\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised to get a smile or even an answer back. STM drivers will generally welcome everyone on board and salute them when they get off. I had drivers recognize me and talk to me just like that (remember, I am not good with people!). I even had one watch for me arriving to the stop from the other side of the street to signal me to wait and not cross foolishly when it wasn\u0026rsquo;t safe as he proceeded to wait for the light change and get me on board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf that\u0026rsquo;s not enough, here\u0026rsquo;s a true STM story: there\u0026rsquo;s a driver that sings the name of bus stops every morning. I have never actually seen it myself but the tellings are true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll that said, some Montreal drivers (but those are in the minority) aren\u0026rsquo;t that friendly. Also, I said all muni drivers hate life and all living creatures on earth but I rode the 31 one evening and the driver was the nicest, going as far as \u003cem\u003efist bumping\u003c/em\u003e me as I got off the bus (this made my day, I love this guy).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"all-people-you-see-in-sf-are-not-attractive-montréal-wins\"\u003eAll People You See in SF are not Attractive, Montréal Wins\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s really surprising. I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m married and it\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m here looking around but living in the city, you see people everyday. You sort of subconsciously assess the beauty of the population around you, I guess. There\u0026rsquo;s probably someone studying that social behavior but I\u0026rsquo;m just there to tell you that the truth is this: it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to make your way to work and back without seeing someone really good looking. Maybe my sample doesn\u0026rsquo;t accurately reflect the larger population of san Francisco, I mostly see people riding muni (could this explain why muni drivers have those gloomy eyes?) but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to make me believe that it is the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMontréal folks are more attractive unless you\u0026rsquo;re blind and then, it\u0026rsquo;s a tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust to give you some perspective, the subject was brought up by my wife after I had passed myself the same reflection. It can\u0026rsquo;t be anything but the absolute truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"changes-don-t-happen-in-montréal-anymore-sf-moves-with-the-wind\"\u003eChanges Don\u0026rsquo;t Happen in Montréal (anymore), SF Moves with the Wind\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven small things never seem to take forever to get done in Montréal.

SF has steep hills all over and cars are omnipresent. Nonetheless, SF wins the bike culture crown. Those bikes are \u003cem\u003eeverywhere\u003c/em\u003e. Buses wait behind, respectfully. When Muni service routes are shutdown for a week, a \u003ca href=\"http://www.sfbike.org/?transit\"\u003ebike train\u003c/a\u003e route is put in place for commuters. There\u0026rsquo;s the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggle\"\u003ewiggle trail\u003c/a\u003e for people to have a relatively flat route (I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to do it any other way). Apparently people have cars (and many) but they also know it\u0026rsquo;s not very wise to drive it during workdays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBikes are king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"so-who-wins\"\u003eSo who Wins?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou could think I regret leaving Montréal and in some ways, I could. Except that I don\u0026rsquo;t really. It\u0026rsquo;s really nice here. And work is great. And there\u0026rsquo;s the ocean, and the golden gate, and all the great tech and the promise of great historical earthquakes. Oh shit shit shit, the earthquakes\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

But I\u0026rsquo;ve had that since I was a teenager so it\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e was I\u0026rsquo;m referring to here. I was actually thinking of this habit of mine of always having some personal project \u003ca href=\"http://dawnofbubbles.com/post/6923528541/creation-as-a-fulltime-dad\"\u003eon a schedule\u003c/a\u003e and never letting that go. To the point where I get mad for being so near my self-imposed deadline and being stressed out about not being able to deliver. So much so that it seems like all potential of fun is gone, all fun is sucked out of it and it really is making life a misery for me and all people around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut that happens only once in a while so it\u0026rsquo;s all good. No problem here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"full\"\u003e\n    \n        \u003cimg src=\"http://alexandrenormand.users.sonic.net/heyitsalex.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/crossroads.jpg\"  /\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n        It\u0026#39;s a Road and I Cross it Everyday to Take the Bus. No Joke.\n        \n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, I\u0026rsquo;m really hitching for some new project. You know, something to brag about and put on my software engineer resume in which in no way helps my “career”. I really need this in my life. It guarantees that I have absolutely no time for entertainment while I entertain an adequate amount of sleep deprivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut back to this project discussion. This time, I\u0026rsquo;m actually thinking of mixing things up a bit. I really do think having a restricted scope helps spur creativity but I feel like I can try something more diversified this time around. I may simply be inspired by the relative chaos I\u0026rsquo;m currently living in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, I can\u0026rsquo;t just bring that up and leave it at that: I\u0026rsquo;ve been living since the beginning of my work life in Montreal and it was great. I have a nice cute family with two kids and they all love it there. So what was I to do next? Well, I applied for a job at some remote location and I got it. Then, I had my family give up everything to come with me in San Francisco where we don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone nor speak the language very well. That, my friend (am I moving too quickly saying that?) is the chaos I was taking about. It\u0026rsquo;s not just \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e, obviously, but you\u0026rsquo;ll have to ask me for more details if you want me to expand on that topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut back on the project topic again. I actually have a few ideas lined up. What usually happens when I have queue of ideas is\u0026hellip;only one gets executed, if any. In the spirit of getting things done, I\u0026rsquo;m doing \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e. Notice that \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e isn\u0026rsquo;t an hyperlink. That\u0026rsquo;s because your already on it (okay, I could have many it an anchor link or something but that would have been annoying and not as much fun as me explaining).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo yes, I\u0026rsquo;m writing a blog. If you know me, you know I can\u0026rsquo;t really express myself very clearly so that might be a challenge\u0026hellip;or good entertainment for you, the reader. It could go either way. Here is me writing a blog like I\u0026rsquo;ve got something to say that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been said already (or just saying nothing, that\u0026rsquo;s been done too).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA blog about anything, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a Montréaler in California. A dad with almost childish looks with kids that will grow up in another country. A French speaking guy who gets unmasked after speaking half a word of English (or did I say that in French?). A weird stranger in a fast-paced and hard-working tech world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that\u0026rsquo;s because Alexandre can\u0026rsquo;t be pronounced correctly in English. That\u0026rsquo;s okay, I can\u0026rsquo;t pronounce anything correctly in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a very climatic opening isn\u0026rsquo;t it? I feel pretty good about this. I think I actually have something good here for a first post. I just have to make sure I\u0026rsquo;m not screwing up the ending (TODO: review that last paragraph before posting).\u003c/p\u003e\n"
