<p><strong>Update: After finishing and reading this post (ok, I <em>skimmed</em> through it), I updated the title to better reflect its content.</strong></p>

<p>So this is going to be one of those serious posts where I tell know how to live your life to &ldquo;enlarge&rdquo; your happiness. This is all going to be bulletproof advice that I may or may not follow myself (but really, <em>trust</em> me, I&rsquo;m just putting that disclaimer there to please lawyers).</p>

<p>On second thought (ok, on <em>initial</em> thought, I hadn&rsquo;t really did any thinking before writing this out), scratch that, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you how to live your life.</p>

<p>I am, however, going to tell you <em>exactly</em>, <em>precisely</em> how to do <em>stuff</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done research, experimentation and just plain thinking (transit time equals free thinking time) over the course of the last few years. I&rsquo;m not putting any references here but I wouldn&rsquo;t <em>just say things</em> so, trust me.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve come to believe is that the key to doing great work consistently lies in two elementary rules:</p>

<h2 id="1-the-seinfeld-chain-http-lifehacker-com-281626-jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">1. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">The Seinfeld Chain</a></h2>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be daily but you should have a schedule with outputs and you should stick to it. Of course, if you&rsquo;re just a slacker constantly putting off tasks, that won&rsquo;t help. You might get some things done once in a while but your chain will look like a bunch of stupid rings. You will look at this and think back at this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">Seinfeld chain</a> and since your efforts are so pathetic, you&rsquo;ll just give up and never get anything done.</p>

<p>Ok, now that we got rid of the self conscious slackers, let&rsquo;s get to the second point&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="2-don-t-overwork-do-work-and-celebrate">2. Don&rsquo;t overwork. Do work and celebrate</h2>

<p>This is pretty intuitive really. You get some good work done and you enjoy the satisfaction. That&rsquo;s it. When you do that, you&rsquo;ve got something to be proud of and something to look forward to for next time. Now, you rest or just do something else. If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re currently in leisure mode so get ready and go back to work (but finish reading first).</p>

<p>The reason we feel like just going on a continuous non stopped stretch is just the structure of work life. Work more, get more done, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3180-a-good-days-work">right</a>? Well, as much as we would like this to be true, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be generally the case. It&rsquo;s less easy to apply this to a 40 hours job where work time is crucial. Don&rsquo;t go using that as an excuse though. If you learn to split tasks into smaller tasks, then it is possible to eventually get to a point when you can leave work everyday having accomplished stuff and feeling good about it.</p>

<p>Ok, that last part was pretty dry but it&rsquo;s the key to something so it had to be said (and read, I really hope you read it).</p>

<p>Until next time, stay curious and don&rsquo;t let you phone run out of battery (unrelated advice but it&rsquo;s really not cool if someone needs to call you and you can&rsquo;t get the call).</p>

<p><em>Coming next: how to master a second language as a grown-up?</em></p>

<p><em>(okay, it won&rsquo;t be my next post, it&rsquo;s more of an actual question from me to the world! I don&rsquo;t know how, I&rsquo;m so horrendously horrible at this).</em></p>
