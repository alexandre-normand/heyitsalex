        <blockquote>
<p>“I know that I know nothing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a famous saying that resonates profoundly these days.</p>

<p>I don’t believe in sudden triggering factors outside of our reflex for self-biography narration but I will surrender and say that 2013 was a markedly transformative year in my life. That’s when I radically changed my lifestyle to try and fix my degrading type 1 diabetic health. I had already learned about the effectiveness of simple behavioural science principles to power my commitment to make change happen.  I felt the benefits very quickly. In less than 6 months, I had started the reversal of early signs of retinopathy. But I had also learned that things weren’t so simple in nutrition.</p>

<p>March 2013 was when I learned that I had trusted the wrong sources about nutrition and health more generally. What else did I assumed as universal truth but wasn’t? 18 months later, I’m still wondering what’s the best diet for me. I learned that there isn’t one solution that fits everyone. I’ve also learned about several things that affect health but, more importantly, I learned that it’s only a tiny fraction of what there is to know.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I also learned about rewilding. I then learned that rewilding means different things to different people. I learned some of its definitions. I learned about new ideas on waste, consumption and the economy religion. I learned about tiny housing and a minimalistic way of life. None of it is simple. There are some very compelling perspective on the modern life but there’s also no clear and unique solution and path forward.</p>

<p>So, I’m sitting here bombarded with very assertive statements and solutions to achieve health, accomplishment, happiness and financial freedom. But I also know things are complicated and personal. There’s rarely a single answer. There’s a lot of information to process and lots of questions to pounder.</p>

<p>This post isn’t about how to be creative, productive, healthy or happy. I wouldn’t know what to prescribe because it’s complicated. This post isn&rsquo;t about how everything is fucked and there&rsquo;s no solution. Even if that were true, we woulnd&rsquo;t know until we try something.</p>

<p>The truth is that I&rsquo;m uncertain what this post is about. But maybe that&rsquo;s what the theme. My search for my very own personal answers is full of uncertainties.</p>

<p>And while uncertainties that can be paralyzing, there&rsquo;s one thing I do know and that it&rsquo;s nice things usually happen when you try something different. If nothing more than ruling out an idea while prompting a fresh set of questions and opening up new paths to answers. Here&rsquo;s to finding the next path.</p>
