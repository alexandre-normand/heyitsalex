        I&#39;m really sorry about this. I wanted an image and I thought drawing myself octocat-style would be cool. I guess it could have been if I had done a better job. For the record, I blame the tools. No SketchBook Ink for me next time.

<p>I have one thing I want to say today: I love <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Since this would just barely be worthy of a tiny tweet (and not even a _good_ one), I&rsquo;m going to stretch this as far as I can to get to a blog post length. Just because I feel like blogging today. Yes, that&rsquo;s just how it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>

<p>The past week was really great. Don&rsquo;t you care to know why? Well, fine, I&rsquo;m telling anyway.</p>

<p>It starts with me just trying to get some data on the distribution of the data across regions in hbase. I thought it was something we should be looking at.</p>

<p>Enters <a href="https://github.com/sentric/hannibal">Hannibal</a>.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, I had cloned it, built it and had it running against one of our clusters. The visuals are really good and it definitely increases our ability to quickly see where we&rsquo;re at compared to a text output (which can also be done pretty easily with an hbase shell script).</p>

<p>With this running instance on our data quickly came the realization that we&rsquo;d use this for real. And, like, <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>On closer look, I noticed issues with getting compaction logs. Also, I started thinking of some things we might tweak to make it easier to have this deployed and running internally.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into the details of the changes involved. The <strong>process</strong> is really the topic I had in mind when sitting down to write this. Or rather the lack thereof really.</p>

<p>Did you notice? I just lied straight to your face and I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t budge. Actually, there _is_ a process but Github makes it all so easy and fun that it doesn&rsquo;t feel like the drag we so often associate with processes.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how this lays out: You read about this thing or google your way to it. You need this thing and someone already wrote it. It starts here and then&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Clone, build, run and use the thing.</p></li>

<li><p>There&rsquo;s something missing or that could use some improvement.</p></li>

<li><p>You feel the urge to fix it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s the critical part right there. It&rsquo;s often where things <em>get complicated</em>. You might need to file a ticket first with steps to reproduce. You might need to sell people of that feature you think _should definitely_ be in the scope of the project. You know, it&rsquo;s complicated™. But Github helps. Let&rsquo;s get on with how this goes with it&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You fork it. A one click step.</p></li>

<li><p>You do the work. And it&rsquo;s the most fun part. You&rsquo;re excited because this is something that bugged <em>you</em>. It&rsquo;s something _you_ care about.</p></li>

<li><p>Done with the changes? Now it&rsquo;s pull requesta extravaganza! This is when you get to show off the interesting work you&rsquo;ve cared so much about. Also, because it&rsquo;s cool to work with people excited about your project, interesting discussions follow. Meeting new folks. You know, <em>talking_ (or, more accurately, _typing</em>).</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m just describing one scenario here but let&rsquo;s say everything is right and your changes were merged into the upstream repo. Doesn&rsquo;t this feel <em>great</em>? It&rsquo;s almost silly but I just feel like a little boy and I want to show mommy how proud I am of the thing I just did. Even for a one line change. I&rsquo;d like to show the whole world about this thing I just did. Please refrain though. People will run away screaming if you do this too often. And maybe even the first time you do it. So, please, don&rsquo;t!</p></li>

<li><p>You just feel like smiling.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To be fair, you can get the same great rewarding feeling from contributing to any open source project even if that&rsquo;s not hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. But the entry barrier is just a little bit higher. It takes more time. Some of that precious and limited energy that you have is spent on the _other_ stuff that, well, isn&rsquo;t as much fun.</p>

<p>Anything to make the process so easy it just seems to <em>not</em> exist is an amazing feat. <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> really enables tons of changes (okay, I just made that up but I really think it&rsquo;s a good uneducated guess) by just making a path available from discovering a personal need to getting it done. Github is empowering people to fix it <em>immediately</em>. And we all know how momentum is important.</p>

<p>I think I won&rsquo;t shock anyone if I say we wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back to a world without <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. More than <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a>, Github really brings the _develop with pleasure_ motto to life.</p>

<p>Dear Github, I love you. Never leave me.</p>
